79111733,how to derive attributeslabels from short plain text descriptions ner llm,nlp artificialintelligence largelanguagemodel namedentityrecognition,llm would work nicely for this iv done similar tasks before and it worked nicely with minimal training just keep in mind that any of the statistical methods nlp llm ner will never be accurate but for practical purposes i find llms to be more accurate then a custom soup of regular expressions for you task i would use a framework like langchain and the following prompt note you might need to work on your prompt a bit this just an example when run with a model it will create an xml output which would be trivial to parse you can modify the prompt to create different type of outputs but personally i find xml working very well for me keep in mind that llms are not cheap to run but for this tasks given ambiguousness of the domain it is most likely the best choice for this particular task it would be of a penny per label using openai service you might find a cheaper model provider however when working with llm it is very important to ensure accuracy first then optimize for costs the whole thing will probably take hours to build for the intermediate llm developer if you are learning it may vary but this is a perfect project to learn about llms

78285447,whats inside inner vertices in wordvec hierarchical softmax,machinelearning nlp wordvec hierarchical softmax,while there are many slightlydifferent ways to think about it it may help to consider the values in the trained frozen neural network as associated with edges moreso than vertexes nodes the network projection weights leading from an abstract onehot encoding of each known word into the network are essentially the actual perword wordvectors assuming a common case of d vectors the edges from the singleword node to the inner nodes are that words then theres another set of edgeweights from the internal activation to the output layer which is offering the networks training goal of incontext wordprojection in the more common usual default negativesampling approach each output node corresponds to a single predictable word thats a very easy outputshape to visualize and the value of negativesampling is that you only check the activations of the desired word and n more randomly chosen negative words to perform your training updates thats way less calculation than if you checked the output values at all v size of vocabulary output nodes and still works pretty well and doesnt get more expensive with larger vocabularies unless you choose for other reasons to also increase your choice of n negative samples in hierarchical softmax the interpretation of the output nodes is more complicated rather than the activation at a single node indicating the prediction of a single word a varying set of nodes must have the right onoff activations to communicate the variablelength huffmancode of a word so in hs to backprop the network more towards predicting your desired positive word from one input context the algorithm considers just those nodes involved in that words nique coding a smaller set of nodes for the mostommon words but a larger set of nodes for rarer words and nudges each of them more towards the pattern that predicts the desired word again you get the sparse training efficiency of updating only a tiny subset far smaller than all v nodes each trainingstep but the cost will vary based on the target word and grow with the log of v as vocabularysize grows further as the originalnaive assignment of codes is based strictly on wordfrequency quitedissimilar words may have verysimilar codings perhaps causing more wordtoword interference there were hints in the original wordvecc release of refining the hs wordcodings over time to ensure similar words share similar huffman codings but ive seen litle followup on that idea perhaps because of the dominance of negativesampling so in an hs network the weights from the inneractivations to the output nodes are tuned to indicate by huffman code which word is the preferred prediction from a context in the wordvec implementation im most familiar with python gensim these hidden to output weights are not even randomly initialized at the beginning instead left as and i think this was directly copied from the initialization of googles wordvecc release but as soon as training begins the explict random initialization of those input weights initial random input wordvectors means those weights are immediately perturbed in a way that at st is nearly all random but becomes more helpful over the sgd training so those inner weights start but quickly start reflecting the influence of the initiallyrandom word vectors and training examples theyre usually not harvested from the network after training like the final wordvectors are but would be kept around if you wanted to continue training later and perhaps provide a running start to future training runs in the negativesampling case some research suggested those hiddentooutput weights could also be interpreted as same embeddingsize perword vectors with some usefulness see paper by mitra et al at microsoft about dual word embeddings but given the varyinglength codings of output words in the hs case extractinginterpretating those outputweights would be trickier in the implementation im most familiar with the it may help to think instead of the shallow neural networks projection layer effectively the wordvectors themselves as each virtual single node hot word has its embeddingsize outweights and hidden layer

75545619,how seqseq context vector is generated,deeplearning nlp lstm attentionmodel seqseq,in a sequencetosequence seqseq model the context vector is a representation of the input sequence generated by the encoder and used by the decoder to generate the output sequence the encoder produces a set of hidden states that capture relevant information about the input sequence up to that point in time the context vector is then generated by combining these hidden states in some way in the attention mechanism the context vector is a weighted sum of the hidden states while in a basic seqseq model without attention the context vector is typically the final hidden state produced by the encoder during decoding the context vector is used by the decoder to generate each element of the output sequence the context vector is not the same as the average of the word embeddings in the input sequence and is a learned representation that is specific to the task at hand and model architecture the formula you provided ci ij hj is the standard formula for computing the context vector using the attention mechanism in a basic seqseq model without attention the context vector is typically the final hidden state produced by the encoder this hidden state is then used as the initial hidden state for the decoder which generates the output sequence one step at a time during decoding the context vector is used by the decoder to generate each element of the output sequence at each time step the decoder takes in the previous output element and the current hidden state and produces a new hidden state and output element as an example lets say we have arabic sentence and we want to translate it to english sentence here is what happens we accomplish this task by training arabic as input sequence and arabic as output sequence now the model consists of main components an encoder and a decoder the encoder takes in the english sentence as input and produces a fixedlength context vector that summarizes the input sequence the decoder then takes in the context vector and generates the corresponding english translation one word at a time andrew ng videos on youtube provide perfect explanation i myself learned it from him

64704461,open source pretrained models for taxonomygeneral word classification,machinelearning nlp classification wordembedding,sounds like wordnet would be a good fit for this task wordnet is a lexical database that organises words in a hierarchical tree structure like a taxonomy and contains additional semantic information for many words see eg wordnet for cat here for a browserbased demo a word thats one hierarchy level above another word is a so called hypernym the hypernym for cat is eg feline with wordnet in nltk you can get the hypernyms of two words until you get the same hypernym for cat and dog the common hypernym is animal see example code here you ask for a machine learning solution in your question a classical approach would be word vectors via gensim but they will not give you a clear common category based on a database created by experts like wordnet but just give you words that often occur next to your target words cat dog in the training data i think that machine learning is not necessarily the best tool here see example
64684506,transformers get named entity prediction for words instead of tokens,nlp pytorch huggingfacetransformers,there are two questions here annotating token classification a common sequential tagging especially in named entity recognition follows the scheme that a sequence to tokens with tag x at the beginning gets bx and on reset of the labels it gets ix the problem is that most annotated datasets are tokenized with space for example where o indicates that it is not a namedentity bartist is the beginning of the sequence of tokens labelled as artist and iartist is inside the sequence similar pattern for medium at the moment i posted this answer there is an example of ner in huggingface documentation here the example doesnt exactly answer the question here but it can add some clarification the similar style of named entity labels in that example could be as follows adapt tokenizations with all that said about annotation schema bert and several other models have different tokenization model so we have to adapt these two tokenizations in this case with bertbaseuncased the expected outcome is like this in order to get this done you can go through each token in original annotation then tokenize it and add its label again when you add cls and sep in the tokens their labels o must be added to labels with the code above it is possible to get into a situation that a beginning tag like bartist get repeated when the beginning word splits into pieces according to the description in huggingface documentation you can encode these labels with to be ignored something like this should work

63105091,build a multiclass text classifier which takes vectors generated from wordvec as independent variables to predict a class,python machinelearning nlp wordvec textclassification,you can average a bunch of wordvectors for symptoms together to get a single featurevector of the same dimensionality if your wordvectors are d each averaging them together gets a single d summary vector but such averaging is fairly crude and has some risk of diluting the information of each symptom in the averaging as a simplified stylized example imagine a nurse took a patients temperature at pm and found it to be f then again at am and found it to be f a doctor asks hows our patients temperature and the nurse says the average f wow says the doctor its rare for someone to be so onthedot for the normal healthy temperature next patient averaging hid the important information that the patient had both a fever and dangerous hypothermia it sounds like you have a controlledvocabulary of symptoms with just some known capped and notverylarge number of symptom tokens about in such a case turning those into a categorical vector for the presenceabsence of each symptom may work far better than wordvecbased approaches maybe you have different symptoms or different symptoms either way you can turn them into a large vector of s and s representing each possible symptom in order and lots of classifiers will do pretty well with that input if treating the listofsymptoms like a textofwords a simple bag of words representation of the text will essentially be this categorical representation a dimensional onehot vector and unless this is some academic exercise where youve been required to use wordvec its not a good place to start and may not be a part of the best solution to train good wordvectors you need more data than you have to reuse wordvectors from elsewhere they should be wellmatched to your domain wordvectors are most likely to help if youve gots tensofthousands to hundredsofthousands of terms and many contextual examples of each of their uses to plot their subtle variationsofmeaning in a dense shared space only texts of tokens each and only unique tokens is fairly small for wordvec i made similar points in my comments on one of your earlier questions once youve turned each row into a feature vector whether its by averaging symptom wordvectors or probably better creating a bagofwords representation you can and should try many different classifiers to see which works best many are dropin replacements for each other and with the size of your data testing many against each other in a loop may take less than an hour or few if at a total loss where to start anything listed in the classifiers upperleft area of this scikitlearn graphical guide is worth trying if you want to consider an even wider range of possibilities and get a vaguelyintuitive idea of which ones can best discover certain kinds of shapes in the underlying highdimensional data you can look at all those demonstrated in this scikitlearn classifier comparison page with these graphical representations of how well they handle a noisy d classification challenge instead of your d challenge

62904623,python named entity recognition ner replace named entities with labels,python nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,you may indeed loop over text and labels as taha explained but this is a bad idea in the general case this loop may mix entities which have the same name but different types or sometimes not be an entity in the text as you only rely on the label of the entity consider for instance the following in i sent emails i saw a statue of washington in washington you wont be able to distinguish occurrences of or washington this may look like a rare case but wouldnt it be better to avoid such errors especially for very long documents as far as i understood the ner python module looks like a simple binding to spacy so i guess you can access the startchar and endchar values of each entity to avoid this with some basic python programming by the way i also think this should be more efficient from a computational point of view

61669621,how to use kmeans algorithm to do attribute clustering after ner,machinelearning deeplearning nlp namedentityrecognition,i am not completely sure what they mean the best solution is to directly ask the papers authors about this but it seems that the clustering has been performed to do something related to entity linking entity linking is the process of disambiguating the named entities discovered in the text by matching them with the unique identities eg wikipedia articles or database entries for example washington can be linked to the city washington dc the state washington or the person george washington on the other hand the strings stanford stanford university leland stanford junior university lsju stanford u stanford uni university of stanford stanfordedu stanfurd and a few more do refer to the same institution this information is not provided by pure ner models because they can tell you only that eg in i graduated from stanford u in stanford u is a school but not that it is some specific school you may want to use nel because ner model predicts only that stanford u is the name of a educational institution or that teslamotors is the name of a company then the nel model predicts that stanford u really means stanford university and teslamotors really means tesla inc so you can think that named entity linking somehow refines the recognized entities it is useful for example if you perform some downstream task eg classification of resumes using the found entities and tesla inc is present in the training sample whereas teslamotors isnt in this situation named entity linking will improve the generalizing ability of the downstream model because after nel both entities will be treated exactly the same way the authors of the paper however dont seem to have the database for all their domainspecific entities schools degrees skills job position etc or dont have a labeled dataset to train a model for entity linking therefore instead of classical entity linking they just merge similar occurrences of entites into clusters hoping that the strings that end up in the same cluster do really refer to the same identity this approach may seem crude but it is better than no linking at all and it can provide a good starting point for manually labellinglinking the clusters and thus creating a dataset for training a supervised model for entity linking

61486629,problem adding custom entities to spacys ner,nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,in principle the way youre trying to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem by retraining it on its old predictions seems like a good approach to me however if you are having duplicate versions of the same sentence but annotated differently and feeding that to the ner classifier you may confuse the model the reason is that it doesnt just look at the positive examples but also explicitely sees nonannotated words as negative cases so if you have bob lives in london and you only annotate london then it will think bob is surely not an ne if then you have a second sentence where you annotate only bob it will unlearn that london is an ne because now its not annotated as such so consistency really is important i would suggest to implement a more advanced algorithm to resolve the conflicts one option is to always just take the annotated entity with the longest span but if the spans are often exactly the same you may need to reconsider your label scheme which entities collide most often i would assume org and orgname do you really need org perhaps the two can be merged as the same entity
61319219,listbased named entity recognition for search engine how to scale,search memory solr nlp namedentityrecognition,one obvious bruteforce solution is just to make your search index distributed you create eg nodes with a dictionary of million entities in each one you run them in parallel and you merge the results another solution which may be complementary to splitting the index is to keep your entities not in a simple list but instead in a prefix tree aka trie or in a graph of ahocorasick these data structures speed up substring search by a lot because they try to match all the entities with your query in a single pass exploiting the fact that many entities have identical substrings in them in fact i have used pyahocorasick to look up a few million entities movies songs actors etc in short queries and it seemed to scale very well formally the time complexity of ahocorasick does not depend on the total number of entities only on the number of matched entities in the concrete query therefore if the search gets slow which is unlikely it makes sense to see what entities generate lots of false positive matches and remove them from the index in my case after removing very common entities such as it its a movie name the matcher sped up even more here is an example first we get the entities to search for k cities then we create the automaton that can match entities cities and now actually apply this index to lookup entities in the text naive search gives the same results but takes about ms here is the notebook with my code

twothirds of cases the tumors express estrogen receptor alpha eralpha encoded by esr here we performed wholeexome sequencing of breast cancer tissues classified according to esr expression and samples of whole blood and detected somatic mutations in cancer tissues with high levels of esr expression of the somatic mutations validated by a different deep sequencer a novel nonsense somatic mutation c ct pgln in transcriptional regulator switchindependent family member a sina was detected in breast cancer of a patient part of the mutant protein localized in the cytoplasm in contrast to the nuclear localization of eralpha and induced a significant increase in esr mrna the sina mutation obviously enhanced mcf cell proliferation in tissue sections from the breast cancer patient with the sina c ct mutation cytoplasmic sina localization was detected within the tumor regions where nuclear enlargement was observed the reduction in sina mrna correlates with the recurrence of erpositive breast cancers on kaplanmeier plots these observations reveal that the sina mutation has lost its transcriptional repression function due to its cytoplasmic localization and that this repression may

57494201,spacy generate generic sentences and then train the model on top of that is it a good idea,nlp entity spacy namedentityextraction,this approach is called augmenting training data with synthetic data it can definitely be a very useful technique when your training data is limited however in my experience it should be used carefully or with moderation otherwise you run the risk of overfitting your model to the training data in other words your model might have difficulty generalizing beyond the entities in your food list because it has seen those so many times during training and it comes to expect those also as you mentioned overfitting may arise through through repeated sentence structures this synthetic permutation data should be as generated as randomly as possible one can use the sample method in the python random library for each sentence in the initial training data set draw a small sample of foods from your list and for each of the sampled foods substitute that food in the sentence to produce a new sentence a slightly different approach which can perhaps generalize better over unseen food entities is instead of using the food list from your training sentences is to download a list of foods and use that lists of foods can be found on github for example here or here or extracted from wikipedia here in both cases using a sample size of n produces an nfold increase in training data

55018426,why the fasttext word embedding could generate the representation of a word from another language,python gensim wordembedding fasttext nlp,in fact the proper behavior for a fasttext model based on the behavior of facebooks originalreference implementation is to always return a vector for an outofvocabulary word essentially if none of the supplied strings character ngrams are present a vector will still be synthesized from whatever random vectors happen to be at the same lookup slots in the models fixedsize collection of ngram vectors in gensim up through at least the fasttext class will throw a keyerror all ngrams for word absent from model error if none of an outofvocabulary words ngrams are present but thats a buggy behavior that will be reversed to match facebooks fasttext in a future gensim release the pr to correct this behavior has been merged to gensims develop branch and thus should take effect in the next release after im not sure why youre not getting such an error with the specific model and dataset youve described perhaps your fasttextmodel was actually trained with different text than you think or trained with a verysmall nondefault minn parameter such that a single appearing inside the sentiment data is enough to contribute to a synthesized vector for but given that the standard fasttext behavior is to always report some synthesized vector and gensim will match that behavior in a future release you shouldnt count on getting an error here expect to get back an essentiallyrandom vector for completely unknown words with no resemblance to training data

54628104,why parse tree is not generated in my code for my sentences,python pythonx parsing nlp nltk,a parse tree is not generated for q because the sentence is not in the language of the grammar ie the goal symbol s does not derive the sentence you should write the sentence down on paper and then manually try to construct a parse tree for it youll find that it cant be done and the specific ways in which it fails to be possible should suggest ways that the grammar needs to change in order to make it possible for example heres one problem not the only one in the grammar nnp derives both big and data and nothing else derives either of them so roughly speaking the sentence begins with nnp nnp and yet s is incapable of deriving a form that starts with nnp nnp

53219016,detecting sections of a pdf with pdfminer,python pdf nlp textprocessing pdfminer,to understand why youre getting false positives you need to understand more about pdf pdf unlike what you may think is not a wysiwyg format in fact you should think of pdf as a container of instructions it has its own programming language that tells viewing or rendering software what to do example go to position set the font to arial set the fontsize to draw the glyph for character h go to position draw the glyphs for characters ello some blocks of instructions are grouped together in what is called an object each object gets its own number and objects can reference each other objects are indexed in the cross reference table known as the xref table some of the challenges when doing textextraction from pdf objects dont need to appear in logical reading order sometimes whitespace is explicitly written sometimes it is achieved by simply moving the drawing cursor pdfs do not always have logical structure embedded in them so whilst you may be able to clearly see a column layout from the viewpoint of the software this is less clear i have worked at itext a software company that focuses solely on pdf related technology and extracting text in the way you describe from a random document in a foolproof way is something that simply isnt possible with current software packages there are tons of exceptions that may break your workflow formulas appearing in text tables tables with row span and column span images with text flowing around them footnotes headers footers

52981868,rule based named entity recognizer without parts of speech label or any other information,nlp entity namedentityrecognition named partofspeech,typically ner relies on preprocessing such as partofspeech tagging named entities are typically nouns so not having this basic information makes the task more difficult and therefore more prone to error there will be certain patterns that you could look for such as the one you suggest although what do you do with sentenceinitial named entities you could add certain regular expression patterns with prepositions eg titlecasetoken of the titlecasetoken would match leader of the free world prime minister of the united kindom and alexander the great you might also want to consider patterns to match acronyms such as sncf ibm un etc a first step is probably to look for some lexical resources ie word lists like country names first names etc and build from there you could use spacy python or tokensregex java to do tokenbased matching and not use the linguistic features they add to the tokens

51363605,mnemonic generation using lstms how do i make sure my model generates meaningful sentence using a loss function,machinelearning keras nlp deeplearning,first i have a couple of unrelated suggestions i do not think you should output the glove vector of each word why wordvec approaches are meant to encapsulate word meanings and would probably not contain information about their spelling however the meaning is also helpful in order to produce a meaningful sentence thus i would instead have the lstm produce its own hidden state after reading the first two letters of each word just as you currently do i would then have that sequence be unrolled as you currently do into sequences of dimension one indexes into a index to word map i would then take that output process it through an embedding layer that maps the word indexes to their glove embeddings and i would run that through another output lstm to produce more indexes you can stack this as much as you want but or levels will probably be good enough even with these changes it is unlikely you will see any success in generating easytoremember sentences for that main issue i think there are generally two ways you can go the first is to augment your loss with some sense that the resulting sentence being a valid english sentence you can do this with some accuracy programtically by pos tagging the output sentence and adding loss relative to whether it follows a standard sentence structure subject predicate adverbs directobjects etc though this result might be easier than the following alternative it might not yield actually natural results i would recommend in addition to training your model in its current fashion to use a gan to judge if the output sentences are natural sentences there are many resources of keras gans so i do not think you need specific code in this answer however here is an outline of how your model should train logically augment your current training with two additional phases first train the discriminator to judge whether or not the output sentence is natural you can do this by having an lstm model read sentences and giving a sigmoid output to whether or not they are natural you can then train this model on some dataset of real sentences with labels and your sentences with labels at roughly a split then in addition to the current loss function for actually generating the mnemonics add the loss that is the binary crossentropy score for your generated sentences with true labels be sure to obviously freeze the discriminator model while doing this continue iterating over these two steps training each for epoch at a time until you start to see more reasonable results you may need to play with how much each loss term is weighted in the generator your model in order to get the correct tradeoff between a correct mnemonic and an easytoremember sentence

49804717,how to generate glove embeddings for pos tags python,pythonx machinelearning nlp spacy wordembedding,most word embedding models still rely on an underlying assumption that the meaning of a word is induced by its usage context for example learning a wordvec embedding with skipgram or continuous bag of words formulations implicitly assumes a model in which the representation vector of the word is based on the context words that cooccur with the target word specifically by learning to create embeddings that best solve the classification task of distinguishing pairs of words that contextually cooccur from random pairs of words socalled negative sampling but if the input is changed to be a sequence of discrete labels pos tags this assumption doesnt seem like it needs to remain accurate or reasonable part of speech labels have an assigned meaning that is not really induced by the context of being surrounded by other part of speech labels so its unlikely that standard learning tasks which are used to produce word embeddings would work when treating pos labels as if they were words from a much smaller vocabulary what is the overall sentence analysis task in your situation added after question was updated with the learning task at hand lets assume you can create pos input vectors for each sentence example if there are n different pos labels possible it means your input will consist of one vector from word embeddings and another vector of length n where the value in component i represents the number of terms in the input sentence that possess pos label pi for example lets pretend the only pos labels possible are article noun and verb and you have a sentence with article noun verb noun then this transforms into and probably you want to normalize it by the length of the sentence lets call this input pos for sentence number and pos for sentence number lets call the word embedding vector input for sentence as sentence sentence will be calculated by looking up each word embedding from a separate source like a pretrained wordvec model or fasttext or glove and summing them up using continuous bag of words and the same for sentence its assumed that your batches of training data would already be processed into these vector formats so a given single input would be a tuple of vectors the looked up cbow embedding vector for sentence same for sentence and the calculated discrete representation vector for pos labels of sentence and same for sentence a model that could work from this data might be like this

48817017,nlp speed of named entity recognition stanfordner,python pythonx nlp stanfordnlp namedentityrecognition,the bottleneck is the taggertag method it has a big overhead therefore calling it for every sentence results in a really slow program unless theres an additional need for splitting the book into sentences id process the whole text at once now if what you wanted to know is say what sentence each character is mentioned in then you could first get the characters names in characters like in the code above and then loop through the sentences checking if an element from characters exists there if file size is a concern although a txt file of most books shouldnt be a problem to load into memory then instead of reading the whole book you could read a number n of sentences at once from your code modify your for loop like so the general idea is to minimize the calls to taggertag for its big overhead

45091281,linear crf versus wordvec for ner,nlp namedentityrecognition,crfs and wordvec are apples and oranges so comparing them doesnt really make sense crfs are used for sequence labelling problems like ner given a sequence of items represented as features and paired with labels theyll learn a model to predict labels for new sequences wordvecs word embeddings are representations of words as vectors of floating point numbers they dont predict anything by themselves you can even use the word vectors to build features in a crf though its more typical to use them with a neural model like an lstm some people have used word vectors with crfs with success for some discussion of using word vectors in a crf see here and here do note that with many standard crf implementations features are expected to be binary or categorical not continuous so you typically cant just shove word vectors in as you would another feature if you want to know which is better for your use case the only way to find out is to try both
44993214,linear chain conditional random field sequence model ner,nlp stanfordnlp,both models would be linear chain crf models the important part about the linear chain is that the features depend only on the current label and one direct neighbour in the sequence usually this would be the previous label because that corresponds with reading order but it could also be the future label such a model model would basically process the sentence backwards and i have never seen this in the literature but it would still be a linear chain crf as far as i know the stanford ner model is based on a model that uses the current and the previous label but it also uses an extension that can also look to labels further back it is therefore not a strict linearchain model but uses an extension described in this paper jenny rose finkel trond grenager and christopher manning incorporating nonlocal information into information extraction systems by gibbs sampling proceedings of the nd annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics acl pp

34439208,nltk stanfordnertagger how to get proper nouns without capitalization,python nlp nltk stanfordnlp postagger,firstly see your other question to setup stanford corenlp to be called from commandline or python nltk how to prevent stemming of proper nouns for the proper cased sentence we see that the ner works properly and for the lowered cased sentence you will not get nnp for pos tag nor any ner tag so the question to your question should be what is the ultimate aim of your nlp application why is your input lowercased was it your doing or how the data was provided and after answering those questions you can move on to decide what you really want to do with the ner tags ie if the input is lowercased and its because of how you structured your nlp tool chain then do not do that perform the ner on the normal text without distortions youve created its because the ner was trained on normal text so it wont really work out of the context of normal text also try to not mix it nlp tools from different suites they will usually not play nice especially at the end of your nlp tool chain if the input is lowercased because thats how the original data was then annotate a small portion of the data or find annotated data that was lowercased and then retrain a model work around it and train a truecaser with normal text then apply the truecasing model to the lowercased text see if the input has erroneous casing eg some big some small but not all are proper noun then try the truecasing solution too

32011615,how to create a good ner training model in opennlp,java nlp textmining opennlp namedentityrecognition,the answer to your first question is that the algorithm works on surrounding contexttokens within a sentence its not just a simple lookup mechanism opennlp uses maximum entropy which is a form of multinomial logistic regression to build its model the reason for this is to reduce word sense ambiguity and find entities in context for instance if my name is april i can easily get confused with the month of april and if my name is may then i would get confused with the month of may as well as the verb may for your second part of the first question you could make a list of names that are known and use those names in a program that looks at your sentences and automatically annotates them to help you create a training set however making a list of names alone without context will not train the model sufficiently or at all in fact there is an opennlp addon called the modelbuilder addon designed for this you give it a file of names and it uses the names and some of your data sentences to train a model if you are looking for particular names of generally non ambiguous entities you may be better off just using a list and something like regex to discover names rather than ner as for your second question there are a few options but in general i dont think ner is a great tool for delineating something like gender however with enough training sentences you may get decent results since ner uses a model based on surrounding tokens in your sentence training set to establish the existence of a named entity it cant do much in terms of identifying gender you may be better off finding all person names then referencing an index of names that you know are male or female to get a match also some names like pat are both male and female and in most textual data there will be no indication of which it is to neither human nor machine that being said you could create a male and female model separately or you could create different entity types within the same model you could use an annotation like this using different entity type names of maleperson and femaleperson ive never tried this but it might do ok youd have to test it on your data ner named entity recognition hth

20419028,generating articles automatically,math nlp artificialintelligence computerscience spintax,to begin with a word of caution this is quite the forefront of research in natural language generation nlg and the stateoftheart research publications are not nearly good enough to replace human teacher the problem is especially complicated for students with english as a second language esl because they tend to think in their native tongue before mentally translating the knowledge into english if we disregard this fearful prelude the normal way to go about this is as follows nlg comprises of three main components content planning sentence planning surface realization content planning this stage breaks down the highlevel goal of communication into structured atomic goals these atomic goals are small enough to be reached with a single step of communication eg in a single clause sentence planning here the actual lexemes ie words or wordparts that bear clear semantics are chosen to be a part of the atomic communicative goal the lexemes are connected through predicateargument structures the sentence planning stage also decides upon sentence boundaries eg should the student write i went there but she was already gone or i went there to see her she has already left notice the different sentence boundaries and different lexemes but both answers indicating the same meaning surface realization the semiformed structure attained in the sentence planning step is morphed into a proper form by incorporating function words determiners auxiliaries etc and inflections in your particular scenario most of the words are already provided so choosing the lexemes is going to be relatively simple the predicateargument structures connecting the lexemes needs to be learned by using a suitable probabilistic learning model eg hidden markov models the surface realization which ensures the final correct grammatical structure should be a combination of grammar rules and statistical language models at a highlevel note that content planning is languageagnostic but it is quite possibly culturedependent while the last two stages are languagedependent as a final note i would like to add that the choice of the extra words is something i have glossed over but it is no less important than the other parts of this process in my opinion these extra words should be chosen based on their syntagmatic relation to the given words for further details the two following papers provide a good start complete with process flow architectures examples etc natural language generation in dialog systems stochastic language generation for spoken dialogue systems to better understand the notion of syntagmatic relations i had found sahlgrens article on distributional hypothesis extremely helpful the distributional approach in his work can also be used to learn the predicateargument structures i mentioned earlier finally to add a few available tools take a look at this acl list of nlg systems i havent used any of them but ive heard good things about spud and openccg

13765349,multiterm named entities in stanford named entity recognizer,nlp stanfordnlp namedentityrecognition,this is because your inner for loop is iterating over individual tokens words and adding them separately you need to change things to add whole names at once one way is to replace the inner for loop with a regular for loop with a while loop inside it which takes adjacent nono things of the same class and adds them as a single entity another way would be to use the crfclassifier method call which will give you whole entities which you can extract the string form of by using substring on the original input the models that we distribute use a simple raw io label scheme where things are labeled person or location and the appropriate thing to do is simply to coalesce adjacent tokens with the same label many ner systems use more complex labels such as iob labels where codes like bpers indicates where a person entity starts the crfclassifier class and feature factories support such labels but theyre not used in the models we currently distribute as of

12240566,natural language generation how to test if it sounds natural,text nlp,a lot of nlp stuff works using things called language models a language model is something that can take in some text and return a probability this probability should typically be indicative of how likely the given text is you typically build a language model by taking a large chunk of text which we call the training corpus and computing some statistics out of it which represent your model and then using those statistics to take in new previously unseen sentences and returning probabilities for them you should probably google for language models unigram models ngram models and click on some of the results to find some article or presentation which helps you understand the previous sentence its hard for me to recommend an appropriate tutorial for you because i dont know what your existing background is anyway one way to think about language models is that they are systems that take in new text and tell you how similar the new text is to the training corpus the language model was made out of so if you build language models one out of all the plays written by shakespeare and another out of a large number of legal documents then the second one should be giving you a much higher probability to sentences for some new legal document that just got released as compared to the first model while the first model should give you a much higher probability for some other old english play written by some other author because that play is probably more similar to shakespeare in terms of the kind of words used sentence lengths grammar etc than it is to modern legal language all the things you see the stanford parser give you back for a sentence you give it are generated using language models one way to think about how those features are built is to pretend that the computer tried every possible combination of tags and every possible parse tree for the sentence you gave it and used some clever language model to identify which is most probable sequence of tags and most probable parse tree out there and returned those back to you getting back to your problem you need to build a language model out of what you consider natural sounding text and then use that language model to evaluate the sentences you want to measure the naturalness of to do this you will have to identify a good training corpus and decide on what type of language model you want to build if you cant think of anything better a collection of wikipedia articles might serve to be a good training corpus representing what natural sounding english looks like as for model type an ngram model would probably be good enough for your task more complicated models like hidden markov models and pcfgs the stuff that is powering the stanford page you linked to would definitely make things even better but ngrams are definitely the most simple thing you could start with

12065503,predicting next char in random text generation based on some input file,c nlp,if you really want a characterbased model you wont get very natural looking text as output but it is definitely possible and that model will fundamentally be able to deal with sequences of space characters as well there is no need to remove them from the input if you consider them a natural part of the text what is important is that a markov model does not always fall back to predicting the one character that has the highest probability at any given stage instead it must look at the entire probability distribution of possible characters and chooses one randomly here randomly means it picks a character not predetermined by the programmer still the random distribution is not the uniform distribution ie not all characters are equally likely it has to take into account the relative probabilities of the various possible characters one way to do this is to generate a cumulative probability distribution of characters ie for example if the probabilities are we represent them as then to generate a random character we first generate a uniformly distributed random number n between and and then choose the first character whose cumulative probability is no less than n i have implemented this in the example code below the train procedure generates a cumulative probability distribution of the followingcharacters for every character in the training input the predict procedure applies this to generate random text for a full implementation this still lacks a representation of the probability distribution for the initial character as you see in the main function my output simply always starts with t a representation of the length of the output string or the final character main simply always generates a string of length the code was tested with gcc c option on linux example output below some example output generated by this program as you can see the distribution of space characters follows sort of naturally the distribution found in the input text

10856896,choose or generate canonical variant from multiple sentences,php textmining informationextraction nlp,since your existing metric seems to bias towards shorter phrases you should consider factoring in bigrams into the mix so instead of considering scores for just individual words additionally consider the score for consecutive pairs of words as well eg nivea deo deo rollon rollon dry etc when computing the score for each title factor in the scores for every unigram and bigram you can generate out of the title together but maybe give the bigrams more weight and this should encourage your algorithm to prefer longer phrases if you have large existing corpus of lots of names like these at your disposal consider using something like tfidf what you are doing right can be likened to just using tf using your global corpus you can compute the idf of each unigram and bigram which is basically a measure of unique or rare a word or phrase is across the entire corpus tf the number of times you have seen an ngram within these results idf a global measure of how unique an ngram might be across all results or atleast a very large number of them so when computing the score for a title instead of simply adding up the tfs of each ngram in it you add up the tfidf of each ngram instead rarer ngrams which possibly do a better job at distinguishing this item from all other items have a higher idf so your algorithm should give higher weight to them a lot of junk terms like mindestabnahme would have really high idf but they would have a really small tf so they might not make a big difference alternatively prune off tokens you see fewer than k times to get rid of noise another nlp trick to know about is levenshtein distance which is a way to quantify how similar two strings are you can compute the levenshtein distance between every pair of strings within your results and then try preferring the result which has the lowest average distance from all the other strings this might not work well by itself but factoring this score in with your existing approach might help you navigate some tricky cases

10043293,focused named entity recognition ner,nlp machinelearning namedentityrecognition,one approach may be to use a general nondomain specific tool to detect peoples names use a subject classifier to filter out texts that are not in the domain if the total size of the data set is sufficient and the accuracy of the extractor and classifier good enough you can use the result to obtain a list of peoples names that are closely related to the domain in question eg by restricting the results to those that are mentioned significantly more often in domainspecific texts than in other texts in the case of baseball this should be a fairly good way of getting a list of people related to baseball it would however not be a good way to obtain a list of baseball players only for the latter it would be necessary to analyse the precise context in which the names are mentioned and the things said about them but perhaps that is not required edit by subject classifier i mean the same as what other people might refer to simply as categorization document classification domain classification or similar examples of readytouse tools include the classifier in pythonnltk see here for examples and the one in lingpipe see here

6626884,most efficient way to generate a list of unigrams from a text field in mongodb,mongodb lucene nlp mapreduce opennlp,since you have not provided a sample document object format take this as a sample collection called stories for the given dataset you can use the following javascript code to get to your solution the collection authorsunigrams contains the result all the code is supposed to be run using mongo console first we need to mark of all the new documents that have come afresh into the stories collection we do it using following command it will add a new attribute called mrstatus into each document and assign value inprocess later we will see that mapreduce operation will only take those documents in account which are having the value inprocess for the field mrstatus this way we can avoid reconsidering all the documents for mapreduce operation that have been already considered in any of the previous attempt making the operation efficient as asked second we define both map and reduce function third we actually run the mapreduce function fourth we mark all the records that have been considered for mapreduce in last run as processed by setting mrstatus as processed optionally you can see the result collection authorsunigrams by firing following command
6583160,are there published generative grammars for natural languages,nlp,you might want to look at attempto controlled english and its prologbased tools since statistical parsing came in vogue in the early s grammars have usually not been distributed except for specific problem domains but derived from distributed corpora such as the penn treebank if you can get a hold of that i believe a sample is distributed with nltk you can roll your own grammar by looking at all tree fragments and translating them to rules eg if you find a node labeled s with children labeled np and vp you know there should be a rule s np vp pruning the rules that occur infrequently would be a good idea

4454029,is ner necessary for coreference resolution,nlp stanfordnlp namedentityrecognition,according to the emnlp paper that describes the coref system packaged with stanford corenlp named entities tags are just used in the following coref annotation passes precise constructs relaxed head matching and pronouns raghunathan et al you can specify what passes to use with the dcorefsievepasses configuration property if you want coreference but you dont want to do ner you should be able to just run the pipeline without ner and specify that the coref system should only use the annotation passes that dont require ner labels however the resulting coref annotations will take a hit on recall so you might want to do some experiments to determine whether the degraded quality of the annotations is problem for whatever your are using them for downstream
4001785,can i identify intranet page content using named entity recognition,nlp nltk,it looks like you want to do textdocument classification which is not quite the same as named entity recognition where the goal is to recognize any named entities proper names places institutions etc in text however proper names might be very good features when doing text classification in a limited domain it is for example likely that a page with the name of the head engineer could be classified as engineering the nltk book has a chapter on basic text classification
3837157,what are features generators in natural language processing,nlp,if im reading this correctly i believe feature generation in this quote is referring to the process of extracting features from your text without going into too much detail this is basically getting the dimensions of your data you think would be useful for your predictionclassification task and putting it into a vector representation for example suppose we were trying to create a classifier to determine if an email was spam we might extract features such as containswordnigeria or isfrompersonincontactlist or if we were to follow the quote above we might make specialized features using the html tags such as percentofwordsinhreftag as you might imagine you can go overboard when feature engineering and the real challenge lies is in optimizing your feature set to give you good results on unseen data

3216440,probabilistic generation of semantic networks,machinelearning datamining nlp,there is quite a lot of history behind this kind of task your best start is probably by looking at question answering the general advice i always give is that if you have some highly restricted domain where you know about all the things that might be mentioned and all the ways they interact then you can probably be quite successful if this is more of an openworld problem then it will be extremely difficult to come up with something that works acceptably the task of extracting relationship from natural language is called relationship extraction funnily enough and sometimes fact extraction this is a pretty large field of research this guy did a phd thesis on it as have many others there are a large number of challenges here as youve noticed like entity detection anaphora resolution etc this means that there will probably be a lot of noise in the entities and relationships you extract as for representing facts that have been extracted in a knowledge base most people tend not to use a probabilistic framework at the simplest level entities and relationships are stored as triples in a flat table another approach is to use an ontology to add structure and allow reasoning over the facts this makes the knowledge base vastly more useful but adds a lot of scalability issues as for adding probabilities i know of the prowl project that is aimed at creating a probabilistic ontology but it doesnt look very mature to me there is some research into probabilistic relational modelling mostly into markov logic networks at the university of washington and probabilstic relational models at stanford and other places im a little out of touch with the field but this is is a difficult problem and its all earlystage research as far as i know there are a lot of issues mostly around efficient and scalable inference all in all its a good idea and a very sensible thing to want to do however its also very difficult to achieve if you want to look at a slick example of the state of the art ie what is possible with a bunch of people and money maybe check out powerset
3108602,text mining when to use parser tagger ner tool,python nlp nltk,instead of trying to reinvent the wheel you might want to read up on topic models which basically creates clusters of words that frequently occur together mallet has a readily available toolkit for doing such a task to answer your original question pos tagger parsers and ner tools are not typically used for topic identification but are more heavily used for tasks like information extraction where the goal is to identify within a document the specific actors events locations times etc for example if you had a simple sentence like john gave the apple to mary you might use a dependency parser to figure out that john is the subject the apple is the object and mary is the prepositional object thus you know john is the giver and mary is the receiver and not viceversa
2764116,tag generation from a small text content such as tweets,twitter nlp textextraction nltk textanalysis,two stage approach for multiword tags you could pool all the tweets into a single larger document and then extract the n most interesting collocations from the whole collection of tweets you could then go back and tag each tweet with the collocations that occur in it using this approach n would be the total number of multiword tags that would be generated for the whole dataset for the first stage you could use the nltk code posted here the second stage could be accomplished with just a simple for loop over all the tweets however if speed is a concern you could use pylucene to quickly find the tweets that contain each collocation tweet level pmi for single word tags as also suggested here for single word tags you could calculate the pointwise mutual information of each individual word and the tweet itself ie again this will roughly tell you how much less or more surprised you are to come across the term in the specific document as appose to coming across it in the larger collection you could then tag the tweet with a few terms that have the highest pmi with the tweet general changes for tweets some changes you might want to make when tagging with tweets include only use a word or collocation as a tag for a tweet if it occurs within a certain number or percentage of other tweets otherwise pmi will tend to tag tweets with odd terms that occur in just one tweet but that are not seen anywhere else eg misspellings and keyboard noise like scale the number of tags used with the length of each tweet you might be able to extract or interesting tags for longer tweets but for a shorter word tweet you probably dont want to use every single word and collocation to tag it its probably worth experimenting with different cutoffs for how many tags you want to extract given the tweet length
2661778,tag generation from a text content,python tags machinelearning nlp nltk,one way to do this would be to extract words that occur more frequently in a document than you would expect them to by chance for example say in a larger collection of documents the term markov is almost never seen however in a particular document from the same collection markov shows up very frequently this would suggest that markov might be a good keyword or tag to associate with the document to identify keywords like this you could use the pointwise mutual information of the keyword and the document this is given by pmiterm doc log pterm doc ptermpdoc this will roughly tell you how much less or more surprised you are to come across the term in the specific document as appose to coming across it in the larger collection to identify the best keywords to associate with a document you would just sort the terms by their pmi score with the document and pick the with the highest score if you want to extract multiword tags see the stackoverflow question how to extract common significant phrases from a series of text entries borrowing from my answer to that question the nltk collocations howto covers how to do extract interesting multiword expressions using ngram pmi in a about lines of code eg

1783653,computing precision and recall in named entity recognition,nlp precisionrecall,the way precision and recall is typically computed this is what i use in my papers is to measure entities against each other supposing the ground truth has the following without any differentiaton as to what type of entities they are microsoft corp ceo steve ballmer announced the release of windows today this has entities supposing your actual extraction has the following microsoft corp ceo steve ballmer announced the release of windows today you have an exact match for microsoft corp false positives for ceo and today a false negative for windows and a substring match for steve we compute precision and recall by first defining matching criteria for example do they have to be an exact match is it a match if they overlap at all do entity types matter typically we want to provide precision and recall for several of these criteria exact match true positives microsoft corp the only exact match false positives ceo today and steve which isnt an exact match false negatives steve ballmer and windows any overlap ok true positives microsoft corp and steve which overlaps steve ballmer false positives ceo and today false negatives windows the reader is then left to infer that the real performance the precision and recall that an unbiased human checker would give when allowed to use human judgement to decide which overlap discrepancies are significant and which are not is somewhere between the two its also often useful to report the f measure which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and which gives some idea of performance when you have to trade off precision against recall

39152229,in general when does tfidf reduce accuracy,sentimentanalysis tfidf textclassification naivebayes,the idf component of tfidf can harm your classification accuracy in some cases let suppose the following artificial easy classification task made for the sake of illustration class a texts containing the word corn class b texts not containing the word corn suppose now that in class a you have examples and in class b examples what will happen to tfidf the inverse document frequency of corn will be very low because it is found in almost all documents and the feature corn will get a very small tfidf which is the weight of the feature used by the classifier obviously corn was the best feature for this classification task this is an example where tfidf may reduce your classification accuracy in more general terms when there is class imbalance if you have more instances in one class the good word features of the frequent class risk having lower idf thus their best features will have a lower weight when you have words with high frequency that are very predictive of one of the classes words found in most documents of that class

77700760,can a named entity recognition ner spacy model or any code like an entity ruler around it catch my new further date patterns also as date entities,python pythonx spacy namedentityrecognition spacy,main things each match is one label you have to list label under label you cannot just put all of the regex patterns into one label see a good code that underlines this at add multiple entityruler with spacy valueerror entityruler already exists in pipeline pattern format you have to write orth text or lower and not shape as i tried it above and then in a nested bracket regex see full list at spacy matcher patterns no embedded spaces in regex and you cannot regex match the already tokenized data with words that have spaces since the tokenizer has already split the data into tokens by means of these spaces there arent any spaces left in the tokenized data the only way to match them is to break up any regex with embedded s into separate match tokens see no answer to this question at how to use standard regex with spacys matcher or phrasematcher while allowing spaces inside the regex which is linked with adding regex entities to spacys matcher squared brackets in the spacy guide on the entity ruler the code example explosionspacymasterspacypipelineentityrulerpy that puts two matches in a row instead of a regex with embedded spaces is not bad coding but needed just like that label gpe pattern lower san lower francisco astonishingly you have to write such squared brackets not just for two or more tokens which means that they are neighboured in a row but even one token needs these squared brackets if you add the lower attribute at the beginning you would think that the squared brackets are just a start of a list which they are but the list format seems to be needed also for just one match i checked this with label gpe pattern lower apple which worked while it did not work without the squared brackets the code did not find the word apple as an entity only apple code example a good guide that wraps it up is at a basic named entity recognition ner with spacy in lines of code in python which is followed by a closer look at entityruler in spacy rulebased matching try with entityruler it shows how rulebased matching in spacy works both for phrase matcher and token matcher fixed code with these hints i could find an answer to the question above from spacylangde import german nlp german ruler nlpaddpipeentityruler patterns label org pattern lower apple label org pattern lower apple label gpe pattern lower san label gpe pattern lower san label gpe pattern lower san lower francisco label date pattern text regex label date pattern text regex label date pattern text regex lower regex januarfebruarmrzaprilmaijunijuliaugustseptemberoktobernovemberdezember text regex d label date pattern text regex lower regex januarfebruarmrzaprilmaijunijuliaugustseptemberoktobernovemberdezember label date pattern lower regex januarfebruarmrzaprilmaijunijuliaugustseptemberoktobernovemberdezember text regex d label date pattern lower regex januarfebruarmrzaprilmaijunijuliaugustseptemberoktobernovemberdezember ruleraddpatternspatterns taking the german dezember here for the test of the german regex doc nlpapple is opening its first big office in san francisco on dezember printenttext entlabel for ent in docents out apple org san francisco gpe dezember date mind that the same code but with an english model will only find dezember from spacylangen import english nlp english only if you run this on a german model it will also find dezember with the dot i guess that in english this dot is read as a full stop of a sentence since the sentence tokenizer runs before the word tokenizer the tokens dezember and cannot be found together as one match anymore the code above also proves that you do not need to sort the patterns by the number of tokens like dezember dezember dezember and dezember since it chooses the match with the most tokens by default else it would catch the number of label date at first and then the full date could not be found anymore
77042911,how to use multiple ner pipes with the same spacy nlp object,spacy namedentityrecognition,the problem is that your added customner is listening to the transformer component from encorewebtrf rather than the one from the customnlp pipeline so its not getting the right input and is producing nonsense you need to replace the listeners before you add the component to encorewebtrf customnlpreplacelistenerstransformer ner modeltokvec mainnlpaddpipener sourcecustomnlp namecustomner beforener docs
76451819,what loss function does space use for named entity recognition ner,spacy lossfunction namedentityrecognition,the answer to this is more complicated than you might expect because spacy uses a transitionbased ner model with an imitation learning objective the best description of the algorithm is this video especially the structured prediction part the actual loss function used to decide between the different actions is also a bit tricky the implementation is here im sure ive described this in other comments but i cant immediately find it basically there may be several equally good transitions and we want the objective function to account for that the equations for this are described in section here
74853108,spacy generalize a language factory that gets a regular expression to create spans in a text,python spacy,i think that you need to follow whats in the documentation for custom components heres how i tried to solve the problem youre facing i would start first by creating the component which should be a class in this case because you have parameters a state in this case the parameters are a list of name name rex rex called regexlist now that you have your component you need a factory to create it with the specified parameters heres how you can do it nlp and name should always be there while regex is the input of your regex component heres a sample of how you can call your newly created component if you created this component in a seperate file custompipepy you can call it this way i hope you found my answer helpful
74224813,how to train several ner models spacy,python spacy spacy,when you use a model as a source of vectors or for that matter a source for any other part of a pipeline spacy will not modify it under any circumstances something else is going on are you perhaps using a different virtualenv does spacyloadencoreweblg work one thing that could be happening but seems less likely is that in some fields you can use the name of an installed pipeline using entry points or a local path if you have a directory named encoreweblg where you are training that could be checked first
74002390,spacy ner extract all persons before a specific word,spacy namedentityrecognition,you can use a matcher to find person entities that precede a specific word pattern enttype person orth asked because each dict corresponds to a single token this pattern would only match the last word of the entity ng you could let the first dict match more than one token with enttype person op but this runs the risk of matching two person entities in a row in an example like before ms x spoke to ms y ms z asked to be able to match a single entity more easily with a matcher you can add the component mergeentities to the end of your pipeline which merges each entity into a single token then this pattern would match louis ng as one token
73856995,how can i use a model trained with the transformers trainer in the spacy pipeline,spacy huggingfacetransformers spacytransformers,spacy uses spacytransformers to wrap huggingface transformers but it only allows using the models as a source of features it doesnt allow using taskspecific heads like ner so theres not an easy way to use this in spacy if you want to load your model as a source of features see the guide here on how to specify your filename another option is to load your huggingface model separately and wrap it as a spacy component but thats kind of involved and usually not very useful

73401971,for spacys ner do i need to label the entire word as an entity,python spacy namedentityrecognition,you cant put an ner label on half a token the tokenizer is run before ner and the ner component attempts to give a label to each whole token so if youre only interested in part of a token the ner component wont be able to figure that out if you dont have some way to separate the tokens in preprocessing it seems like the only thing you can do is label the whole token youre right that will make it harder for the model to learn one alternative is to try training a characterlevel ner component basically split your input into individual characters before training
73355551,how to make spacy ner ignore comparisons,spacy namedentityrecognition spacy,using only ner will not allow you to do that by using a parser in combination with ner you should be able to identify the subject nsubj of your sentences which seem to be the words of interest to you you will need to use a good model though i got good results on the example you gave in comment using encorewebtrf

72772448,spacy adding multiple patterns to a single ner using entity ruler,patternmatching spacy namedentityrecognition,each pattern you add to the ruler is one sequence of tokens so you arent matching each of those terms individually youre matching all of them in a row without punctuation you should add them as separate patterns something like this couple of other things you may need to set overwriteents true to get the results you want see here if your actual input looks like wan flex havelock st wan premium thats not the normal prose the spacy models were trained on and they may not work very well
72520863,is there a way to exclude an apostrophe s from entities in spacys ner component,spacy namedentityrecognition,there is no way to simply configure the component not to do this what you can do is use a small custom component to remove s from any entities see the docs for info on how to use it
72097848,how to load customized ner model from disk with spacy,spacy spacy,the general process you are following of serializing a single component and reloading it is not the recommended way to do this in spacy you can do it it has to be done internally of course but you generally want to save and load pipelines using highlevel wrappers in this case this means that you would save like this and then load it with spacyloadmymodel you can find more detail about this in the saving and loading docs since it seems youre just getting started with spacy you might want to go through the course too it covers the new configbased training in v which is much easier than using your own custom training loop like in your code sample if you want to mix and match components from different pipelines you still will generally want to save entire pipelines and you can then combine components from them using the sourcing feature
71859650,importing ner json into spacy,json spacy spacy,for training data spacy just requires docs that are set like the output you want saved in a docbin so for your case looping through your data and creating docs is the right thing to do you can do that with your examplecreating code and pull out the exreference doc an example is basically just two docs one annotated and one not though its not the only way see the sample code in the training data section of the docs its not exactly the same format as your data but its very similar
71515090,python spacy custom ner how to prepare multiwords entities,pythonx spacy namedentityrecognition,you can just provide the start and end offsets for the whole entity you describe this as treating it as one word but the character offsets dont have any direct relation to tokenization they wont affect tokenizer output you will get an error if the start and end of your entity dont match token boundaries but it doesnt matter if the entity is one token or many i recommend you take a look at the training data section in the spacy docs your specific question isnt answered explicitly but thats only because multitoken entries dont require special treatment examples include multitoken entities regarding bio tagging for details on how to use it with spacy you can see the docs for spacy convert

70502457,do i need to do any text cleaning for spacy ner,python spacy namedentityrecognition,first spacy does no transformation of the input it takes it literally asis and preserves the format so you dont lose any information when you provide text to spacy that said input to spacy with the pretrained pipelines will work best if it is in natural sentences with no weird punctuation like a newspaper article because thats what spacys training data looks like to that end you should remove meaningless white space like newlines leading and trailing spaces or formatting characters maybe a line of but thats about all the cleanup you have to do the spacy training data wont have bullets so they might get some weird results but i would leave them in to start also bullets are obviously printable characters maybe you mean nonascii i have no idea what you mean by muck with the indexes but for some older nlp methods it was common to do more extensive preprocessing like removing stop words and lowercasing everything doing that will make things worse with spacy because it uses the information you are removing for clues just like a human reader would note that you can train your own models in which case theyll learn about the kind of text you show them in that case you can get rid of preprocessing entirely though for actually meaningless things like newlines leading and following spaces you might as well remove them anyway to address your new info briefly yes character indexes for ner labels must be updated if you do preprocessing if they arent updated they arent usable it looks like youre trying to extract skills from a resume that has many bullet point lists the spacy training data is newspaper articles which dont contain any lists like that so its hard to say what the right thing to do is i dont think the bullets matter much but you can try removing or not removing them what about stuff like lowercasing stop words lemmatizing etc i already addressed this but do not do this this was historically common practice for nlp models but for modern neural models including spacy it is actively unhelpful
70391922,how to i update my trained space ner model with new training dataset,python spacy spacy,as far as i know you could retrain your model using your new data examples but instead of starting from a blank model you would now start from your existing model in order to achieve this it will first remove the following line from your trainspacy method and may be receives the model as a parameter then to retrain your model instead of loading a spacy blank model and pass to your training method load your existing model using the load method and then call your training method read more about spacy saveload here one final suggestion in my practice i have obtained better results by retraining a spacy ner model from an existing one such as encorewebmd or encoreweblg adding my custom entities than training from scratch from a spacy blank model all together method update retrain your model i hopethis works for you

70085180,is it possible to export and use a spacy ner model without an vocab and inject tokensvectors on the fly,python spacy,in spacy v not v there are some hidden background steps that register the vectors globally under a particular name for use as features in the statistical models the idea behind this is that multiple models in the same process can potentially share the same vectors in ram to get a subset of vectors to work for a particular text you need to register the new vectors under the right name use the same vectorsname as in the model metadata when creating the vectors will be something like encoreweblgvectors run spacymllinkvectorstomodelsvocab im pretty sure that this will start printing warnings and renaming the vectors internally based on the data shape if you do it repeatedly for different sets of vectors with the same name i think you can ignore the warnings and it will work for that individual text but it may break any other models loaded in the same script that are using that same vectors nameshape if you are doing this a lot in practice you might want to write a custom version of linkvectorstomodels that iterates over the words in the vocab more efficiently for very small vector tables or only modifies the words in the vocab that you know that you need it really depends on the size of the vocab at the point where youre running linkvectorstomodels

69316534,how to update ner model using biluo schema in spacy v,python spacy namedentityrecognition spacy,that error occurs because you passed a keyword argument references to the example class constructor but the constructor takes two positional arguments and one keywordonly argument alignment that is references is not a keyword argument for the example constructor this should fix that error im not sure if the data you posted is representative of your actual data if so there is probably not much value to training a ner on it because it is simply a list of the entities with no context around them in this case you would be better off with a rulebased approach like a phrasematcher
68919242,why am i facing permissionerror while installing spacy encorewebsm on ssh server,python linux ssh pip spacy,as you suspect this is happening because you dont have permission to install to usr normally pip would install there but it looks like your pip is basically running with user which will install to your user home directory instead the spacy models cant be installed directly via pip because they are large data files so they cant be hosted on pypi like ordinary code an unfortunate side effect of this is that some of the options around pip configuration are ignored you can pass extra arguments to the pip install command by appending them to your command so in your case you can do this and everything should work that said i would strongly recommend you learn how to use virtual environments with the virtualenv tool which will make working with python projects easier and allow to you avoid this problem as anything you install will just go in the local virtualenv rather than your global pip install

68061849,get spacy ner to search only for company name and not waste computing power on anything else using existing language models,python spacy,you cant change the models to only tag one named entity you can ignore entities you dont care about trivially you cant cut out the other entities because they arent like separate functions the model uses its knowledge about all the different types to help it figure out ambiguous cases like knowing john smith is a person but john deere is probably a company the good news is that it is not processing useless information or wasting computing power if you trained a model to recognize just org entities it wouldnt be faster or anything
68035891,how can i getting ner named entity recognition for one word,python spacy namedentityrecognition junitjupiter,the spacy models are trained on newspaperlike texts some of the labels they have are things like per person and org organization but it learns what these are based on newspaper articles so if you have a news article like this john smith of eggplant limited reported a new product today then it would be labelled like this john smith per of eggplant limited org reported a new product today so the named entities are proper nouns in your example customer is not a proper noun so theres no reason it would be tagged as per its a little weird that its tagged as org and id consider that an error as to why it has an error there its hard to say exactly but models arent perfect and they do have errors so you have to be able to deal with issues like that in your application

67252812,cant evaluate custom ner in spacy using cli,python spacy spacy,from spacy v onwards pipeline components are expected to support an exclude keyword on their todisk method you can add the exclude keyword to your function give it a default and simply not use its value in the function body and this error should be resolved for completeness heres the migration guide for the transition from v to v which may include some additional interesting pointers for you
67250719,train two consecutive ner pipes in spacy,python spacy namedentityrecognition spacy,there are several parts to this you can have two ner components in one spacy pipeline though because of issues and this isnt going to work the way you want it to pipelines cannot set annotations during training for downstream components this is a limitation that is being worked on and should be resolved soon ner annotations cannot be overlapping this is a design decision and is not going to change soon it can be worked around with a custom component but its extra work i would want the classifier to first tag the citations and only then tag the entities within each citation do you actually need the whole citation tag separately or are you designing this as a twostage process to improve performance for some reason if its the latter i would just try training on the secondstage detailed annotations first and see if you actually have a problem im doubtful a twostage process would actually make things easier if you actually need the whole citation then you can just extract chains of the detailed entities into a single span theres no need to have a separate model for that i recommend you take a good look at the section on combining models and rules in the docs it has examples like expanding personal names to include titles like mr or dr or using dependency parse info that seem applicable to your problem

66158457,how much data context needed to train custom ner spacy model,machinelearning model spacy namedentityrecognition,generally named entity recognition relies on the context of words otherwise the model would not be able to detect entities in previously unseen words consequently the list of titles would not help you to train any model you could rather run string matching to find any of those titles in cv documents and you will even be guaranteed to find all of them no unknown titles though i you could find or less real cvs and replace the job names by those in your list or others then you are all set to train a model capable of ner this would be the way to go i suppose just download as many freely available cvs from the web and see where this gets you if it is not enough data you can augment it for example by exchanging the job titles in the data by some of the titles in your list

65134056,ner should i include common prefixes in labeled entities,spacy namedentityrecognition,it depends on the neural network architecture you use lets assume you use spacy v and its default neural architecture which is a cnn in this case the architecture is going to slide through your text according to a specific window ie x number of words before the date entity and x number of words after the date entity with this approach every time the token date appears in the text it is likely that the neural network will recognize that the entity date sits next to it in this case my suggestion would be to include only the annotate the xxxxxxxx date as an entity it will give the model more flexibility in determining what is a date entity however testing is always the best way to find out whats best so give it a try

61028824,spacy ner doesnt seem to correctly recognize hyphenated names,spacy namedentityrecognition,i initially thought this would be a mismatch between the tokenizer and the training data but its actually a problem with how the regex that handles some words with hyphens is loaded from the saved model a temporary fix for spacy v models which you have to do every time after loading a french model is to replace the problematic tokenizer setting with the correct default setting import spacy from spacylangfr import french nlp spacyloadfrcorenewsmd nlptokenizertokenmatch frenchdefaultstokenmatch description cest jeansbastien durand qui leur a dit pierre dupond nest pas venu boston comme attendu louisjean sest tromp claire a bien choisi text nlpdescription labels setwlabel for w in textents for label in labels entities etext for e in textents if labelelabel entities listentities printlabel entities output the french ner model is trained on data from wikipedia so it still doesnt do very well on the entity types for this particular text
60939415,is spacy supporting custom types for named entity recognition,spacy,it does support custom entities cf this section titled training an additional entity type for example to add a label called myanimal you can use training data like such and feed that into either an existing ner model as additional training or a newly created ner pipe however a caveat the ml model is optimized for recognizing named entities which are usually capitalized nouns like john london or the times you can also try to train it on more generic things like numbers but it may not work as well

60176633,does the notation of a named entity label type in spacy have to match with the notation of the annotated label type in the training data,spacy trainingdata namedentityrecognition webanno,yes of course you want to keep annotations aligned if its a oneoff operation it might be easiest to bruteforce the problem by replacing the string in your data the more canonical option would appear to be tagmap quote you need to define how your tags map down to the universal dependencies tag set their example

59921660,can i use the spacy command line tools to train an ner model containing an additional entity type,spacy,ines answered this for me on the prodigy support forum i think whats happening here is that the spacy train command expects the base model you want to update to already have all labels added that you want to train it processes the data as a stream so its not going to compile all labels upfront and silently add them on the fly so if you want to update an existing pretrained model and add a new label you should be able to just add the label and save out the base model this isnt quite writing no code but its pretty close
59444065,differentiate between countries and cities in spacy ner,python spacy,as other answers have mentioned gpe for the pretrained spacy model is for countries cities and states however there is a workaround and im sure several approaches can be used one approach you could add a custom tag to the model there is a good article on towards data science that could help you do that gathering training data for this could be a hassle as you would need to tag citiescountries per their respective location in the sentence i quote the answer from stack overflow spacy ner model training includes the extraction of other implicit features such as pos and surrounding words when you attempt to train on single words it is unable to get generalized enough features to detect those entities an easier workaround to this could be the following install geonamescache then use the following code to get the list of countries and cities the documentation states that you can get a host of other location options as well use the following function to get all the values of a key with a certain name from a nested dictionary obtained from this answer load up two lists of cities and countries respectively then use the following code to differentiate output
59319207,ner entity recognition country filter,python entity spacy namedentityrecognition,as mentioned you can filter for the loc or gpe entity provided by the spacy language model however be aware that the ner language model needs to have a sentence contex to be able to predict the location entities sp spacyloadencorewebsm loop over every row in the bio column for text in dfbiotolist use spacy to extract the entities doc sptext for ent in docents check if entity is equal loc or gpe if entlabel in loc gpe printenttext entlabel here the link to the spacy ner documentation edit here is the full list of english spacy entity types from the documentation person people including fictional norp nationalities or religious or political groups fac buildings airports highways bridges etc org companies agencies institutions etc gpe countries cities states loc nongpe locations mountain ranges bodies of water product objects vehicles foods etc not services event named hurricanes battles wars sports events etc workofart titles of books songs etc law named documents made into laws language any named language date absolute or relative dates or periods time times smaller than a day percent percentage including money monetary values including unit quantity measurements as of weight or distance ordinal first second etc cardinal numerals that do not fall under another type source
59200123,converting spacy training data format to spacy cli format for blank ner,python spacy,edit is close but youre missing a step where you add the entities to the document this should work it would be good to add a builtin function to do this conversion since its common to want to shift from the example scripts which are just meant to be simple demos to the train cli edit you can also skip the somewhat indirect use of the builtin biluo converters and use what you had above

57747872,what is the good metric to evaluate ner model trained in spacy,machinelearning spacy namedentityrecognition,it depends on your application whats worse missing an entity or wrongly flagging something as an entity if failing to label an entity false negative is bad then you care about recall if wrongly flagging a nonentity as an entity false positive is bad you care about precision if you care about both precision and recall the same use f if you care about precision false positives twice as much as recall false negatives use f you can do fb for any b to express what you care about the formula is shown and explained on the wikipedia page for f score edit answering the direct question from the original post the system does badly at location and the date entities the others look good if it were me i would try to use ner to extract all dates as one entity then try to build a separate system rule based or a classifier for distinguishing between the different kinds of dates for location you could use a system that focuses on just geoparsing such as mordecai

57551479,conversion of custom data to spacy ner format,spacy,spacy has builtin converters for some common formats but this isnt quite one of them i think the easiest one to convert to would be the conll ner format which would need two additional spaceseparated columns with placeholder values in between the words and tags so that the iob tags are in the th column no o bnum p o r o name o ryan bper dsouza bper put blank lines between sentences and if you have multiple documents in one file you can add this between documents to separate them then you can use a builtin converter also are you sure two bper tags in a row is correct for ryan dsouza in your data
57535597,restrict entity types in spacy ner,spacy,short answer no you cannot restrict ner to not tag specific tags or the opposite what you can do is limit it in code or modify the model see long answer limiting it in code is just filtering the retrieved entities but it wont solve your problem with missclassifications long answer you can restrict ner in spacy but not with a simple parameter currently why not simple ner is a supervised machine learning task you provide text with tagged entities it trains and then attempts to predict new instances from the parameters it learned beforehand if you want ner only to recognize certain entities such as orgs you have to train a new model only with org instances if youre familiar with machine learning concepts youll understand it this way in a multi class classification task you cannot simply remove a class without retraining the entire model with filtered train data check this page for more info on ner training

56752216,how do i handling exceptions with python generators using spacy,python pythonx exception generator spacy,it looks like your main problem is that your trycatch statement will currently halt execution on the first error it encounters to continue yielding files when an error is encountered you need to place your trycatch further down in the forloop ie you can wrap the with open context manager note also that a blanket trycatch is considered an antipattern in python so typically you will want to catch and handle the errors explicitly instead of using the general purpose exception i included the more explicit ioerror and oserror as examples lastly because you can catch the errors in the generator itself the nlppipe function no longer needs the astuple param edit to answer followup question note you are still reading the contents of the text documents one at a time as you would have without a generator however doing so via a generator returns an object that defers the execution until after you pass it into the nlppipe method spacy then processes one batch of the text documents at a time via its internal utilminibatch function that function ends in yield listbatch which executes the code that openscloses the files at a time in your case so as regards any nonspacy related errors ie errors associated with the openingreading of the file the code i posted should work as is however as it stands both your oswalk and my pathpathrglob are indiscriminately picking up any file in the directory regardless of its filetype so for example if there were an png file in your tmp folder then spacy would raise a typeerror during the tokenization process if you are wanting to capture those kinds of errors then your best bet is to anticipate and avoid them before sending them to spacy eg by amending your code with a whitelist that only allows certain file extensions rglobtxt if you are working on a project that for some reason or another cannot afford to be interrupted by an error no matter the cost and supposing you absolutely needed to know at which stage of the pipeline the error occurred then one approach might be to create a custom pipeline component for each default spacy pipeline component tagger dependencyparser etc you intend to use you would then need to wrap said components in the blanket error handlinglogging logic having done that you could then process your files using your completely custom pipeline but unless there is a gun pointed at your head i would not recommend it much better would be to anticipate the errors you expect to occur and handle them inside your generator perhaps someone with better knowledge of spacys internals will have a better suggestion though
56748048,how to tag named entities to prepare training data for custom named entity recognition with spacy,regex pythonx spacy namedentityrecognition,you may build a regex from all values in your dic to match them as whole words and upon a match grab the key associated with the matched value i assume the value items are unique in the dictionary they can contain whitespaces and only contain word characters no special ones like or see the python demo
56384231,casesensitive entity recognition,python spacy namedentityrecognition,spacys pretrained statistical models were trained on a large corpus of general news and web text this means that the entity recognizer has likely only seen very few alllowercase examples because thats much less common in those types of texts in english capitalisation is also a strong indicator for a named entitiy unlike german where all nouns are typically capitalised so the model probably tends to pay more attention to that if youre working with text that doesnt have proper capitalisation you probably want to finetune the model to be less sensitive here see the docs on updating the named entity recognizer for more details and code examples producing the training examples will hopefully not be very difficult because you can use existing annotations and datasets or create one using the pretrained model and then lowercase everything for example you could take text with proper capitalisation run the model over it and extract all entitiy spans in the text next you lowercase all the texts and update the model with the new data make sure to also mix in text with proper capitalisation because you dont want the model to learn something like everything is lowercase now capitalisation doesnt exist anymore btw if you have entities that can be defined using a list or set of rules you might also want to check out the entityruler component it can be combined with the statistical entity recognizer and will let you pass in a dictionary of exact matches or abstract token patterns that can be caseinsensitive for instance lower nike would match one token whose lowercase form is nike so nike nike nike nike etc
55582282,add custom generator to spacys class,python class generator spacy,well default attribute is the value which is returned when neither getter nor setter is set hence thats what was returned property or function if you remove the property decorator you can store some static information this way you want to set getter as you did in you answer as this is the operation which is called when you want to get the value of attribute setter would have to be created when changing the value like this setter would be good to provide other value than default though i havent used that approach so far finally i have found a clean way of extending spacy and imo more readable than the one presented example of lemmatization extension as you can see the only thing one has to use is the call overloaded method no need for generator but you could use it as well depending on context of your task
54872150,generating similar named entitiescompound nouns,spacy,if you havent seen it yet you might want to check out sensevec which allows learning contextsensitive vectors by including the partofspeech tags or entity labels quick usage example of the spacy extension sv senseveccomponentpathtoredditvectors nlpaddpipesv doc nlpua sentence about natural language processing mostsimilar docsvmostsimilar natural language processing noun machine learning noun computer vision noun see here for the interactive demo using a sensevec model trained on reddit comments using this model car park returns things like parking lot and parking garage and donald trump gives you sarah palin mitt romney and barack obama for ambiguous entities you can also include the entity label for example niagara fallsgpe will show similar terms to the geopolitical entitiy gpe eg the city as opposed to the actual waterfalls the results obviously depend on what was present in the data so for even more specific similarities you could also experiment with training your own sensevec vectors

53236010,how do i handle new line characters in my sentences spacy ner,python spacy,jupyter if the problem is in jupyter you need to have x around strings that are on several lines like this in your case that would be correct me if im wrong but it looks like youve copy pasted the data which is why this can happen you could simply resolve the issue within jupyter by just deleting the newline alternatively i would suggest that you import data to jupyter not using copy paste remove newline character if you want to remove the newlines within string there are many options here is one explanation line import of regex modul line use method sub that substitutes first input n with in string out this string has many lines that continues here and here im guessing that you might be using pandas so to do this on a column you can do the following
51682957,how response generation works in rasa core,machinelearning chatbot spacy rasanlu rasacore,the rasa stack is flexible enough to support both use cases the documentation v for your question can be found at tldr rasa offers a builtin templated based nlg however it also allows you to connect to an external http server for nlg what happens in that server is up to you and it could be a neural net based nlg server but that needs to be done by you template driven nlg from the docs the default format is to include the utterances into your domain file this file then contains references to all your custom actions available entities slots and intents one section of your domain file will include a templates section here is an example from the docs advanced nlg neural nets and ml from the docs retraining the bot just to change the text copy can be suboptimal for some workflows thats why core also allows you to outsource the response generation and separate it from the dialogue learning the bot will still learn to predict actions and to react to user input based on past dialogues but the responses it sends back to the user are generated outside of rasa core if the bot wants to send a message to the user it will call an external http server with a post request to configure this endpoint you need to create an endpointsyml and pass it either to the run or server script the core will contact your server with information from the the conversation including the user utterance intent and slots filled your server then would have a neural net based nlg developed by you which would return the text that the bot should display to the user

47443976,formatting training dataset for spacy ner,json format trainingdata namedentityrecognition spacy,it wasnt clear from your question whether youre also asking about the csv extraction so ill just assume this is not the problem if it is this should be pretty easy to achieve using the csv module if the csv data is messy and contains a bunch of stuff combined in one string you might have to call split on it and do it the hacky way if youre able to extract the sentence and data column in a format like this youre actually very close to spacys training format already it seems like your data counts the end character differently and with an offset of compared to spacy so youll have to adjust this by subtracting im probably making this a lot more verbose than it should be but i hope this makes it easier to follow this should give you training data that looks like this
47388438,named entity recognition upper case issue,namedentityrecognition spacy,the xxentwikism model was trained on wikipedia so its very biased towards what wikipedia considers and entity and whats common in the data it also tends to frequently recognise i as an entity since sentences in the first person are so rare on wikipedia so posttraining with more examples is definitely a good strategy and what youre trying to do sounds feasible the best way to prevent the model from forgetting about the uppercase entities is to always include examples of entities that the model previously recognised correctly in the training data see the catastrophic forgetting problem the nice thing is that you can create those programmatically by running spacy over a bunch of text and extracting uppercase entities see this section for more examples of how to create training data using spacy you can also use spacy to generate the lowercase and titlecase variations of the selected entities to bootstrap your training data which should hopefully save you a lot of time and work

43489724,train corpus for ner with nltk ieer or conll corpus,python nltk namedentityrecognition,the nltk provides everything you need read the nltk books chapter on learning to classify text it gives you a worked example of classification then study sections and from chapter which show you how to work with iob text and write a chunking classifier although the example application is not named entity recognition the code examples should need almost no changes to work although of course youll need a custom feature function to get decent performance you can also use the nltks tagger or another tagger to add pos tags to your corpus or you could take your chances and try to train a classifier on data without partofspeech tags just the iob named entity categories my guess is that pos tagging will improve performance and youre actually much better off if the same pos tagger is used on the training data as for evaluation and eventually production use

37960667,training iob chunker using nltktagbrilltrainer transformationbased learning,python nltk postagger textchunking,the nltk brill trainer api i wrote it does handle training on sequences of tokens described with multidimensional features as your data is an example of however the practical limits may be severe the number of possible templates in multidimensional learning increases drastically and the current nltk implementation of the brill trainer trades memory for speed similar to ramshaw and marcus exploring the statistical derivation of transformationrule sequences memory consumption may be huge and it is very easy to give the system more data andor templates than it can handle a useful strategy is to rank templates according to how often they produce good rules see printtemplatestatistics in the example below usually you can discard the lowestscoring fraction say with little or no loss in performance and a major decrease in training time another or additional possibility is to use the nltk implementation of brills original algorithm which has very different memoryspeed tradeoffs it does no indexing and so will use much less memory it uses some optimizations and is actually rather quick in finding the very best rules but is generally extremely slow towards end of training when there are many competing lowscoring candidates sometimes you dont need those anyway for some reason this implementation seems to have been omitted from newer nltks but here is the source i just tested it there are other algorithms with other tradeoffs and in particular the fast memoryefficient indexing algorithms of florian and ngai and probabilistic rule sampling of samuel would be a useful additions also as you noticed the documentation is not complete and too much focused on partofspeech tagging and it is not clear how to generalize from it fixing the docs is also on the todo list however the interest for generalized nonpostagging tbl in nltk has been rather limited the totally unsuited api of nltk was untouched for years so dont hold your breath if you get impatient you may wish to check out more dedicated alternatives in particular mutbl and fntbl google them i only have reputation for two links anyway here is a quick sketch for nltk first a hardcoded convention in nltk is that tagged sequences tags meaning any label you would like to assign to your data not necessarily partofspeech are represented as sequences of pairs token tag token tag the tags are strings in many basic applications so are the tokens for instance the tokens may be words and the strings their pos as in as an aside this sequenceoftokentagpairs convention is pervasive in nltk and its documentation but it should arguably be better expressed as named tuples rather than pairs so that instead of saying you could say for instance the first case fails on nonpairs but the second exploits duck typing so that taggedsequence could be any sequence of userdefined instances as long as they have an attribute token now you could well have a richer representation of what a token is at your disposal an existing tagger interface nltktagapifeaturesettaggeri expects each token as a featureset rather than a string which is a dictionary that maps feature names to feature values for each item in the sequence a tagged sequence may then look like there are other possibilities though with less support in the rest of nltk for instance you could have a named tuple for each token or a userdefined class which allows you to add any amount of dynamic calculation to attribute access perhaps using property to offer a consistent interface the brill tagger doesnt need to know what view you currently provide on your tokens however it does require you to provide an initial tagger which can take sequences of tokensinyourrepresentation to sequences of tags you cannot use the existing taggers in nltktagsequential directly since they expect word tag but you may still be able to exploit them the example below uses this strategy in myinitialtagger and the tokenasfeaturesetdictionary view the setup above builds a pos tagger if you instead wish to target another attribute say to build an iob tagger you need a couple of small changes so that the target attribute which you can think of as readwrite is accessed from the tag position in your corpus token tag and any other attributes which you can think of as readonly are accessed from the token position for instance construct your corpus tokentag tokentag for iob tagging change the initial tagger accordingly modify the featureextracting class definitions
37651057,generate bigrams with nltk,python nltk ngram,nltkbigrams returns an iterator a generator specifically of bigrams if you want a list pass the iterator to list it also expects a sequence of items to generate bigrams from so you have to split the text before passing it if you had not done it to print them out separated with commas you could in python if on python then for example note that just for printing you do not need to generate a list just use the iterator

34198237,how to get jj and nn adjective and noun from the triples generated stanforddependencyparser with nltk,parsing pythonx nltk stanfordnlp triples,linguistically what youre looking out for when you look for triplets that contains a jj and an nn is usually a noun phrase np in a contextfree grammar in dependency grammar what youre looking for is a triplet that contains the the jj and nn pos tags in the arguments most specifically when youre for a constituent branch that contains an adjectival modified noun from the stanforddepdencyparser output you need to look for the predicate amod if youre confused with whats explained above it is advisable to read up on dependency grammar before proceeding see note that the parser outputs the triplets arg pred arg where the argument arg depends on argument arg through the predicate pred relation ie arg governs arg see pythonically now to the code part of the answer you want to iterate through a list of tuples ie triplets so the easiest solution is to specifically assign variables to the tuples as you iterate then check for the conditions you need see find an element in a list of tuples
33603357,how cfg and google ngram can be combined to generate sentences,nltk stanfordnlp ngram,no it is not feasible real sentences have structure and meaning dependencies that go well beyond what can be captured in ngrams i suppose youre thinking of generating a random structure by expanding your cfg then using ngrams to select among the possible vocabulary choices its a pretty simple thing to code chop off your grammar at the partofspeech level generate a sentence with your cfg as a string of pos tags and use the ngrams to fill them out one by one to work with googles entire gram collection youll need a lot of disk space and a huge amount of ram or some clever programming so i recommend you experiment with one of the nltks tagged corpora eg the brown corpus with the universal tagset starting from any text it is not hard to collect its ngrams write a random text generator and confirm that it produces semicohesive but undeniably incoherent and still mostly ungrammatical nonsense
33339588,use lexical pcfg for generating meaningful phrase,python nltk stanfordnlp,a syntactic grammar will generate grammatical sentences but it makes no guarantees that the sentences make sense really theres no way to make sentences that make semantic sense this would require the computer to understand the meaning of what its saying on a deeper level than currently possible you can try to combine your cfg with an ngram language model which should create more locally coherent sentences but still not necessarily globally coherent

30868980,generate random sentence from grammar or ngrams,python nltk ngram sentence,if im getting it right and if the purpose is to test yourself on the vocabulary you already have learned then another approach could be taken instead of going through the difficult labor of nlg natural language generation you could create a search program that goes online reads news feeds or even simply wikipedia and finds sentences with only the words you have defined in any case for what you want you will have to create lists of words that you have learned you could then create search algorithms for sentences that contain only nearly only these words that would have the major advantage of testing yourself on real sentences as opposed to artificiallyconstructed ones which are likely to sound not quite right in a number of cases an app like this would actually be a great help for learning a foreign language if you did it nicely im sure a lot of people would benefit from using it
30664677,extract list of persons and organizations using stanford ner tagger in nltk,python nltk stanfordnlp namedentityrecognition,thanks to the link discovered by vaulstein it is clear that the trained stanford tagger as distributed at least in does not chunk named entities from the accepted answer many ner systems use more complex labels such as iob labels where codes like bpers indicates where a person entity starts the crfclassifier class and feature factories support such labels but theyre not used in the models we currently distribute as of you have the following options collect runs of identically tagged words eg all adjacent words tagged person should be taken together as one named entity thats very easy but of course it will sometimes combine different named entities eg new york boston and baltimore is about three cities not one edit this is what alvass code does in the accepted anwser see below for a simpler implementation use nltknechunk it doesnt use the stanford recognizer but it does chunk entities its a wrapper around an iob named entity tagger figure out a way to do your own chunking on top of the results that the stanford tagger returns train your own iob named entity chunker using the stanford tools or the nltks framework for the domain you are interested in if you have the time and resources to do this right it will probably give you the best results edit if all you want is to pull out runs of continuous named entities option above you should use itertoolsgroupby if netaggedwords is the list of word type tuples in your question this produces person rami eid organization stony brook university location ny note again that if two named entities of the same type occur right next to each other this approach will combine them eg new york boston and baltimore is about three cities not one

8941269,initialize hiddenmarkovmodeltrainer object,python machinelearning nltk hiddenmarkovmodels,hidden markov models are called so because their actual states are not observable instead the states produce an observation with a certain probability the classical use of hmms in the nltk is pos tagging where the observations are words and the hidden internal states are pos tags look at this example to understand what the states and symbols parameters mean in this case for gesture recognition with hmm the observations are temporal sequences of some kind of feature modeling symbols of the geometrical input data in your case you use clustering also called zoning see section of this paper yang xu hidden markov model for gesture recognition for some other possible models to my understanding the set of internal states doesnt have any meaningful interpretation the number of internal states used in the training of an hmm for each gesture is simply a parameter that has to be experimented with for an example see this paper yamato ohya ishii recognizing human action in timesequential images using hmm the number of states is set to which is criticized as being too high in this master thesis just to cite an example of this being a modifiable parameter so i would try it with this code

29487186,named entity recognition using weka,weka namedentityrecognition,in my opinion weka wont currently be the best machine learning software to do ner as far as i know weka does classify sets of examples for ner it may be done either by tokenizing sentences in tokens in that case sequence ie contiguity will be lost new and york are two separate examples the fact that those words are contiguous wont be taken into account in any way by keeping chunks sentences as examples sequences can then be kept as a whole and filtered stringtowordvector for instance but one class has to be associated for each chunksentence for instance oooblociloco is the class of the whole sentence in your example in both cases contiguity is not taken into account which is really disturbing also as far as i know this is the same for r this why sequence labelling ner morphosyntax syntax and dependencies are usually done using software that determines a token category using current word but also previous next word etc and can output single tokens but also multitoken expressions or more complicated structures for ner currently crf are usually used for that see crf crfsuite wapiti mallet

24689265,textmining of twitter db in rapidminer evaluates all comments in a only way,twitter svm textmining rapidminer,i dont have access to the data so i cant be sure for certain but i assume one of the attributes contains the complete tweet text as a few words with that assumption the process documents operator needs to contain operators to split the text into tokens use the tokenize operator for this and simply place it inside each of the process documents operators in addition the word list output generated by the process documents for the training operation should be connected to the process documents operator which builds the test set this is important as it eliminates any additional attributes from appearing in the test set that correspond to words that have not been seen during the training and therefore ensures the model will be applied correctly
21715354,how whether a string is randomly generated or plausibly an english word,java text datamining textmining,i had to solve a closely related problem for a source code mining project and although the package is written in python and not java it seemed worth mentioning here in case it can still be useful somehow the package is nostril for nonsense string evaluator and it is aimed at determining whether strings extracted during sourcecode mining are likely to be classfunctionvariableetc identifiers or random gibberish nostril does not use a dictionary but it does incorporate a rather large table of ngram frequencies to support its probabilistic assessment of text strings example the following code will produce the following output the project is on github and i welcome contributions if you really need a java implementation perhaps we can make nostril compatible with python and you can try to use jython to run it from java

76265747,computing the cosine similarity of embeddings generated by the dolly model on the hugging face hub,python numpy huggingfacetransformers valueerror,theres a couple of things happening here dollyvb gives you multiple embeddings for a given text input where the number of embeddings depends on the input you provide for example while the model provides embeddings also called vectors for the first sentence in dataset it provides embeddings for the subsequent cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors the code you provided tries to compare multiple vectors of one sentence with multiple vectors of another sentence which violates the aforementioned operation that cosine similarity performs therefore before performing the similarity computations we need to condense the embeddings into a single vector the code below uses a technique called vector averaging which simply computes the average of the vectors its required to call npaverage which is used for vector averaging and npnormalize for each sentence individually in dataset the code below runs without error and returns a cosine similarity of for the first comparison where we compare the sentence to itself which is expected moreover the undefined npnan angular difference between the two identical vectors of the first comparison also makes sense

75931144,change the number of layers of a pretrained huggingface pegasus model used for conditional generation,pytorch huggingfacetransformers huggingface,from what i understand you are trying to use a pretrained model from huggingface for inference this model contains different layers encoder layers decoder layers by default for the pretrained model you use if you want to use internal states of the model which is equivalent to ignoring some of the final layers you can create the model with model pegasusforconditionalgenerationfrompretrainedgooglepegasuspubmed and then use the parameter outputhiddenstatestrue of the model inference call and use the embedding from any internal layer but you cannot bypass only intermediate layers since the following layers are dependant on it if you want to change the structure of the network by adding layers you cannot use a pretrained model since the layers you are trying to add would have random weights so you would have to create your new model from the config and train it on data that you have access to you can try to initialize some of the layers of your model with weights from the pretrained one but you wont have good results before training since the model still has some completely random weights

60125466,transforming the data stored in a csv or parquet file to feed a keras lstm model using a generator in tensorflow,python tensorflow keras generator lstm,i think your best bet is converting your csv file to tfrecord format this data format is designed for handling the my data doesnt fit in to memory case if you write your own generator your trying to mimic the behavior of the tfrecords do you really need the data to be in csv format if your really want the generator start from tfdatadatasetfromgenerator using this method might create a bottleneck for io for training your network i strongly advise you convert your data to tfrecords especially an lstm which probably will take a long time to train as using tfrecords also reduces training time as it enables tensorflow to optimize the io
59208377,what should be the ideal validation accuracy of a lstm based text generator,python tensorflow keras lstm,there is no minimum limit for accuracy in any of the machine learning or deep learning problemits as many say garbage in garbage out quality of data and with a decent model will give you good accuracy generally these accuracy benchmark is set for the standard dataset available on an open internet like squad race swag glue and many more usually the state of the art models will check their performance on these datasets and set a accuarcy benchmark specific to these dataset coming to your problem you can tell the model is performing goog based on accuracy and the evaluation metric you are using generally in nlp to calculate loss is bit tricky considering your case where you are trying to predict the end of a sentence where there is no fixed dimension the reason being that the same information can be expressed in multiple ways with varying number of words by looking at the validation and test accuracy of your model it looks decent but before pushing the accuracy you should worry about the overfitting problem also the model should not be biased on your data you can try with different metrics to evaluate the model and you can compare the results on your own i hope this answers your question happy learning
57245390,error with input shapes for timeseriesgenerator in a lstm stacked rnn,python keras deeplearning timeseries lstm,the length parameter in timeseriesgenerator refers to the number of timesteps to extract from the sequence therefore in your example with lengthnlag as nlag your generator is generating subsequences of length the error is being thrown because you have set and finaldatasetshape so your model expects input sequences of length as for predict the next days you need to decide whether you want to predict days after a selection of subsequences in your current sequence or whether you wish to predict days after the full sequence which would require more labelled time points to train against in both cases you should consider feeding the output of your rnn back in as the input
55648920,setting keras variables in generator,python tensorflow keras lstm,generators are multithreaded so the graph used inside the generator will run in a different thread than that created the graph so accessing the model form generator will access a different graph a simple but bad solution is to force the generator to run in the same thread as the one the one that created the graph by setting workers debug code output you can see the graph objects are different making workers will force the generator to run single threaded using results in same single threaded generator having access to the same graph however to enable multi threaded generator an elegant method would be to save the graph to a variable in the main process creating the graph and pass it to the generator which uses the passed graph as the default graph
55116638,use keras timeseriesgenerator function to generate squence group by some id,python keras lstm,you have to write custom data generator below code should fit your custom ids based batch generation which you can use as a baseline and coustomize it as as required i am creating a generator for each id and storing it in tgs the noof batches are the sum of batches in each generator idxj maps a index to corresponding generator idxi maps a index to a batch in the the generator mapped by idxj output

54288969,keras lstm model for textgeneration purpose,python keras neuralnetwork lstm,i rewrote full answer now it works at least compiles and runs cant say anything about convergence first i dont know why you use sparsecategoricalcrossentropy instead of categoricalcrossentropy it could be important i change the model a bit so it compiles and use a categoricalcrossentropy if you need a sparse one change the shape of a target also i change batchshape to shape argument because it allows to use batches of different shape its easier to work with and the last edit you should change generatenoise because an embedding layer awaits a numbers from maxfeatures not the normally distributed floats see a comment in the function edit addressing the last comments ive removed a generatenoise and post modified generateintegernoise function
54030842,character lstm keeps generating same character sequence,python tensorflow keras lstm recurrentneuralnetwork,in your character generation i would suggest sampling from the probabilities your model outputs instead of taking the argmax directly this is what the keras example charrnn does to get diversity this is the code they use for sampling in their example in your code youve got index numpyargmaxprediction id suggest just replacing that with index sampleprediction and experiment with temperatures of your choice keep in mind that higher temperatures make your output more random and lower temperatures make it less random
53902079,beginner question effect of transforming the targets in regression model,scikitlearn statistics lstm datascience hypothesistest,these are very broad questions but here is something that hopefully helps you along why did they apply the exp and logp the documentation that you linked mentions this a synthetic random regression problem is generated the targets y are modified by i translating all targets such that all entries are nonnegative and ii applying an exponential function to obtain nonlinear targets which cannot be fitted using a simple linear model so theyre doing the exp to create a nonlinear target the logp is fit so that it can come close to approximating a gaussian normal distribution because most models make the normalcy assumption is there a way or hypothesis testing technique in python to know which transformation should i apply on my data in order to get better results in lstm there is no onesizefitsall but generally you try different transformations log exp sqrt cubert inverse etc to try to get your features to approximate normal distributions different models make different distribution assumptions about the predictors and many assume a gaussian although some are robust to that assumption being violated so you do feature transforms to try to get them to be as close to normal as you can it cant hurt to have normally distributed features feature scaling on the other hand is done for reasons around model performance and convergence where your model might not find the optimal solution if the domains of your features are vastly different why did they apply it on the whole dataset and then split for train and test in thought the order should be saving the transformation function and use it later on the test not sure how to do it in this case you might be confused between feature transformation and feature scaling applying the transform together or later wont make any difference for eg it makes no difference whether you split first and do the log transform later they do it for convenience debugging and readability of code however feature scaling is a different issue altogether if you deploy your models to production youll likely need to retain the scaling parameters functions and apply them separately to the train test and production data
53289212,create a masking layer in deep learning generative model,python keras deeplearning lstm,the problem is in where you define your input shape i assume the input to your model are tokenized padded sequences therefore the input should not be of shape of the seqlengthsentvocabsize but only of shape seqlengthsent so to fix your issue just replace modeladdmaskingmaskvalue inputshapeseqlengthsent vocabsize with modeladdmaskingmaskvalue inputshapeseqlengthsent
52431372,keras lstm feed sequence data with tensorflow dataset api from the generator,python tensorflow keras lstm recurrentneuralnetwork,i think this answer might be close to what you are looking for you create batches by sliding over windows and then shuffle the input in your case the shuffle function of the dataset api has a reshuffleaftereachiteration parameter which you might probably want to set to false if you want to experiment with setting a random seed and looking at the order of shuffled outputs

48666843,lstm parity generator,python tensorflow neuralnetwork keras lstm,well this might be a really valuable exercise about lstm and vanishing gradient so lets dive into it id start from changing task a little bit lets change our dataset to and model by setting returnsequencestrue changing the loss to binarycrossentropy and epochs so well if we solve this task perfectly then wed also solve the initial task well in out of runs of the setup i provided i observed the following behavior for first few epochs model saturated around of accuracy and then suddenly dropped to of accuracy why have this happened well in lstm a sweet spot for parameters is a synchrony between memory cells dynamics and normal activation dynamics very often one should wait a lot of time in order to get such behavior moreover the architecture needs to be sufficient in order to catch valuable dependencies in a changed behavior we are providing much more insights to a network thanks to which it could be trained faster still it takes some time to find the sweet spot why your network failed vanishing gradient problem and problem complexity its completely not obvious what information network should extract if it gets only a single signal at the end of the sequence of computations this is why it needs either supervision in the form which i provided cumsum or a lot of time and luck in order to finally find a sweet stop on its own

75801400,how do i stop azure tts from playing back the audio while generating samples,python azure texttospeech azurecognitiveservices azurespeech,i found out by trial and error using different options from the azure documentation though they werent particularly helpful it turns out you can use pullaudiooutputstream as your audio config a heads up you may want to remove the riff header if you want to stitch together multiple audio bytearrays without introducing click noises
73873102,running pyttsx espeak texttospeech in docker container creates awful sound quality,python docker audio texttospeech pyttsx,i fixed this issue and will leave this here in case anyone else ever encounters this problem alright so after another day of research and trying stuff out i found out why this is the case pyttsx needs an engine driver to translate text to speech it will use the standard driver of the os if not specified since i was running on osx it defaulted to nsspeechsynthesizer but when i ran the app in docker the os changes to linux and the default driver became espeak nsspeechsynthesizer and espeak have huge differences in quality meaning espeak sounds like a drunk robot there is no way to use nsspeechsynthesizer in docker as it is osx exclusive since i didnt like the result of espeak at all i decided to switch from using pyttsx to using aws polly which can be found here and has amazing quality is easy to use and very cheap for small developers like myself
73686971,azure tts generating garbled result when requesting opus encoding,c linux texttospeech azurecognitiveservices opus,ive received no useful response to this question ive also asked here and here and even tried azures paid support so i gave up and switched from audiokhzbitkbpsmonoopus to oggkhzbitmonoopus which means the opus encoding is wrapped in an ogg container requiring the rather cumbersome libopusfile api to decode it was kind of a pain to implement but it does the job
72149147,avoid using deprecated api for utteranceprogresslistener,java android texttospeech deprecated,you cant its deprecated but not removed that means it needs to be defined you can define it to do nothing or to call onerrorstring int with a faked error code but you cant not define it it wont compile without it
65656063,unable to install pip azurecognitiveservicesspeech within a docker container,python azure docker pip texttospeech,so i seem to have finally got this working now in honesty im not sure i fully understand what has finally caused this pip install to start working however this is my first question here and i think its best to just post what has fixed it for me in case anyone else runs into it dockerfile seems i needed to specify the platform potentially a known error with apple m preview version of docker install the required ubuntu packages for azurecognitiveservicesspeech and then set the env variables as this was also causing an error then build the image with specifying networkhost tag it and the reference the local my dockercompose file as so dockercomposeyml following this all my containers and celery workers run as expected with the azure package i would still be interested to understand what exactly was causing this if anyone has any ideas
52465605,utteranceprogresslistener not being reliably called,android listener texttospeech,the problem is that the ondone method and in fact any of the progress callbacks is run on a background thread and therefore the toast is not going to work and any code that accesses your ui such as settext may or may not work so the methods probably are being called but you just cant see that the solution to this would be to surround the code in your callbacks with runonuithread like this note its probably best to initialize your textview in oncreate along with everything else instead of in the progress callbacks also the purpose of the utteranceid is to give each call to speak a unique identifier that is then passed back to you as the string s argument in the progress callbacks its a good idea to give each call to speak a new most recent id using some kind of random number generator and then checking it in the progress callbacks you can see a similar question and answer regarding this here side note since you have a restart button you should know that on apis

39627529,texttospeechs utteranceprogresslistener is not called when talkback interrupts,android texttospeech talkback,it turns out the method utteranceprogresslisteneronstopstring utteranceid boolean interrupted does capture interrupted speech events i didnt notice before because its not an abstract method so android studio didnt automatically insert it when writing an implementing class whenever a screen reader interrupts the current speech a call to this method will be made with the interrupted argument set to true
38677133,start service after setonutteranceprogresslistener on done,android service texttospeech,you can start the service in the standard way but startservice requires context and if you are inside your progresslistener that will be the context youll need to use if you are using from an activity you can use there are more examples on this question you can of course create an intent and add extras to it before using it in this way
37004546,when to use the utteranceprogresslistener,android texttospeech,did you perhaps mean that reading starts play is gone and stop is visible reading ends play is visible stop is gone anyway the purpose of utteranceprogresslistener is exactly what you are describing its used to monitor the progress of the speech synthesis you can add an utterance id here hellotext to any text that is spoken out but thats not really necessary in your case so the last parameter can be null the utteranceprogresslistener should be added before calling speak you could do that for example in the tts initialization callback oninit if the tts status is texttospeechsuccess it can be a separate class or just an anonymous inner class the onstart method is triggered when speaking starts soon after calling speak so thats one possible place to switch the visible button for example the play button could be switched to a stop button the ondone method is triggered when speaking is finished and its another possible place to switch the visible button for example the stop button could be switched to a play button and as you can see the utterance id is available in both methods if you provided a one in the speak method call it would be useful if you needed to know exactly which text is being spokenfinished being spokenfailed with an error

35049850,unresolved reference inside anonymous kotlin listener,android texttospeech kotlin,kotlin has hardened the variables initialization policy and its now prohibited to reference the variable inside its initializer even in lambdas and object expressions which seems reasonable imagine that a lambda is called immediately before the variable assignment for your case i can suggest as a workaround using an object expression in this quite cumbersome construct this will initialize an anonymous object with inner inside that is acceptable through value property note that the inner initializer uses value property then the value is extracted and can be used but please keep in mind that this trick is unsafe in runtime using value before inner is assigned eg in texttospeech constructor will throw nullpointerexception also ive replaced the oninitlistener with a lambda using sam conversion to be short but object expression can still be used there upd check this question for my effort to generalize this approach using it you can write see the sources on github
32780693,android listener for change in text to speech settings,android texttospeech googletexttospeech,came with a solution which is not really great but it seems to work as it abides by the changes please note i have not introduced a progress dialog and wait until oninit called but here is the logic so here i launch my text to speech settings intent and set a flag to true then in on resume note that destroy does this because my tts stuff is in a helper class what is not good is that the user could go into settings but not change anything which would resort in the old instance being destroyed and a new one made for no productive reason

20296792,ttsutteranceprogresslistener not being called,android texttospeech,found the answer turns out that the tts resources i found online were using a single tts string source so the third parameter in ttsspeakstring text int queuemode hashmap params was set to null to anybody having this issue in the future if you set the third param to null theres no id for the utteranceprogresslistener to track the fix was creating and initializing a hashmap then adding to the included array for each new tts with a new id could be tracked heres the code then before calling ttsspeak then you can call speak with all params

10684067,generic text to speech voice,texttospeech,at the moment there is not that i know of or that a search turned up that is because most highquality tts engines rely on prerecorded words being played out for such a tts to speak in the same voice in all languages it would mean that the same person recorded hisher voice in all those languages there are roughly languages today and to record a dictionary in one language it would take about a month therefore to record all languages it would take years that person would have died by then note that this is an exaggeration one does not need to record a dictionary word by word for a decent tts what is needed to accomplish this is fully computer generated speech however even this is split into dialects as french puts emphasis on different letters then say spanish if it werent then you might have a tts engine speaking fringlish given your street names in different countries the best solution would be to use espeak it has alot of languages built in and always sounds the same robotic and without emotion it can be called via command line and hence can be used in almost any programming language if you know what country the street is in you could have a database of what languages they speak in different countries i once used the geonames database for this and it works well you could then call espeak with the text you want to speak and the language geonames provides a daily dump which you may download and extract the languages you could then store the massive database on a server such as dotcloud alternatively you could use their api but that is limited to uses a day if you do not know what language the country the street is in you can go for more rough methods that will not always work language detection as majority of street names are real words in different countries eg main street you can run language detection and figure out what language to use that way i hear that detectlanguagecom is good for this so while there is no existing method for this you could make one yourself without too much trouble
10508945,how to turn android texttospeech inside gps locationlistener,android gps texttospeech,you will need a reference to a context in order to initialise the tts engine hence it will not work with this or locationthis since both refer to the running instance of your location class which obviously is not a context or subclass of it that being said there are multiple options if you use your location class as anonymous innerclass or nonstatic innerclass in eg an activity or any other class where you can get a reference to a context object you can use a reference to the outer class to initialise the tts engine in stead of trying to initialise the tts engine directly inside the location class initialize it somewhere where you do have a context reference eg the same place where you request the locationmanager for which you already need a context reference create a centralized instance of the tts engine you could set it up as singleton but can also subclass application and keep it around there after it has been initialized you can get and use it more or less anywhere you like
9712887,adding accents to speech generation,algorithm audio signalprocessing texttospeech languagetheory,this question isnt really programming per se its linguistics the programming is comparatively easy for the analysis thats going to be really difficult and in truth youre probably better off getting the user to specify the accent or are you going for an automated story reader however a basic accent is doable with modern textto speech are you aware of the international phonetic alphabet it basically lists all the sounds a human voice can possibly make an accent is then just a mapping a function from the alphabet to itself for instance to make an american accent sound british to an american person though not sufficient to make it sound british to a british person you can derhotacise all the r sounds in the middle of a word so for instance the alveolar trill would be replaced with the voiced uvular fricative lots of corner cases to work out just for this long and short its not easy which is probably why noone has done it im sure a couple of linguistics professors out their would say its impossible but thats what linguistics professors do but youll basically need to read several thick textbooks on accents and pronunciation to make any headway with this problem good luck

71240225,what is right way to sum up wordvec vectors generated by gensim,python gensim wordvec,you can add the vectors with simple python math operators numpy actually doesnt have a cosinesimilarity or cosinedistance function so youd have to use the formula for calculating from the dotproduct unitnorm both of which numpy has or you could leverage the cosinedistance function in scipy and convert it to cosinesimilarity by subtracting it from
67609635,inner workings of gensim wordvec,python gensim wordvec,ive not tried the nonsense parameter epochs but it might behave as you expect have you tried it and seen otherwise however if your real goal is to be able to tamper with the model after initialization but before training the usual way to do that is to not supply any corpus when constructing the model instance and instead manually do the two followup steps buildvocab train in your own code inserting extra steps between the two for even finergrained control you can examine the source of buildvocab its helper methods and simply ensure you do all those necessary things with your own extra steps interleaved the word vectors in the wv property of type keyedvectors are essentially the input projection layer of the model the data which converts a single word into a vectorsizedimensional dense embedding you can think of the keys word token strings as being somewhat like a onehot wordencoding so assigning into that structure only changes that input projection vector which is the word vector usually collected from the model if you need to tamper with the hiddentooutput weights you need to look at the models synneg or syn for hs mode property
62235365,models generate different results when moving to azure machine learning studio,python scikitlearn gensim azuremachinelearningservice,definitely empathize with the issue youre having every data scientist has struggled with this at some point the hard truth i have for you is that azure ml studio classic isnt really capable of solving this works on my machine problem however the good news is that azure ml service is incredible at it studio classic doesnt let you define custom environments deterministically only add and remove packages and not so well even at that because ml services execution is built on top of docker containers and conda environments you can feel more confident in repeated results i highly recommend you take the time to learn it and im also happy to debug any issues that come up azures machinelearningnotebooks repo has a lot of great tutorials for getting started i spent two hours making a proof of concept that demonstrate how ml service solves the problem youre having by synthesizing your code sample before you shared your notebook jake vanderplass sklearn example and this azure ml tutorial on remote training im no tsne expert but from the you can see that the tsne outputs are the same when i run the script locally and remotely this might be possible with studio classic but it would be hard to guarantee that it will always work

51616074,sharing memory for gensims keyedvectors objects between docker containers,python mmap gensim wordvec,after extensive debugging i figured out that mmap works as expected for numpy arrays in keyedvectors object however keyedvectors have other attributes like selfvocab selfindexword and selfindexentity which are not shared and consumes gb of memory for each object
45195169,gensim docvec generating huge file for model,python semantics gensim wordvec docvec,docvec models can be large in particular any wordvectors in use will use bytes per dimension times two layers of the model so a dimension model with a word vocabulary will use just for the vectors array itself there will be additional overhead for the dictionary storing vocabulary information any docvectors will also use bytes per dimnsion so if you train a vectors for a million doctags the model will use just for the docvectors array if youre using arbitrary string tags to name the docvectors therell be additional overhead for that to use less memory when loaded which will also result in a smaller store file you can use a smaller vocabulary train fewer docvecs or use a smaller vector size if youll only need the model for certain narrow purposes there may be other parts you can throw out after training but that requires knowledge of the model internalssourcecode and your specific needs and will result in a model thats broken and likely to throw errors for many other usual operations
43776572,visualise wordvec generated from gensim using tsne,scikitlearn datavisualization gensim wordvec,two parts to the answer how to get the word labels and how to plot the labels on a scatterplot word labels in gensims wordvec modelwvvocab is a dict of word object of numeric vector to load the data into x for tsne i made one change this accomplishes two things it gets you a standalone vocab list for the final dataframe to plot and when you index model you can be sure that you know the order of the words proceed as before with now lets put xtsne together with the vocab list this is easy with pandas so import pandas as pd if you dont have that yet the vocab words are the indices of the dataframe now i dont have your dataset but in the other so you mentioned an example df that uses sklearns newsgroups would look something like scatterplot i like the objectoriented approach to matplotlib so this starts out a little different lastly the annotate method will label coordinates the first two arguments are the text label and the tuple using iterrows this can be very succinct thanks to ricardo in the comments for this suggestion then do pltshow or figsavefig depending on your data youll probably have to mess with axsetxlim and axsetylim to see into a dense cloud this is the newsgroup example without any tweaking you can modify dot size color etc too happy finetuning
40205725,gensim generating lsi model causes python has stopped working,python pythonx gensim latentsemanticindexing latentsemanticanalysis,it seems that the issue was the function used in the tutorial maybe downgraded or something so i changed the line to and it actually worked fine
34166369,generator is not an iterator,python gensim wordvec,generator is exhausted after one loop over it wordvec simply needs to traverse sentences multiple times and probably get item for a given index which is not possible for generators which are just a kind of stacks where you can only pop thus requiring something more solid like a list in particular in their code they call two different functions both iterate over sentences thus if you use generator the second one would run on an empty set it should work with anything implementing iter which is not generatortype so wrap your function in an iterable interface and make sure that you can traverse it multiple times meaning that prints your collection twice
78869378,generator is not learning in one to many cgans,deeplearning onetomany mnist generativeadversarialnetwork cgan,issues one of the pain points in training a model is that they become powerful quickly that it is they just learn without processing the information i would suggest few things adjusting learning rates by decreasing the learning rate of the discriminator relative to the generators this will slow down the discriminators training giving the generators more opportunity to learn for example implementing a gradient penalty term in the discriminator loss function to enforce smoothness in the discriminators decision boundary can significantly help the model a lot i will point you to this repo for more information ref githubrepo try lower values such as for real images and slightly higher values like for your fake images look at how to implement a feature matching loss to the generators this loss helps in computing statistics of the features extracted from an intermediate layer of the discriminator a reference to guide you githubreffeaturematchingimplementation i dont see any batching of any sort note i maybe wrong but you should consider it if you havent reduce discriminator capacity you said that you already reduced the number of filters and added dropout layers which are good steps however you can further reduce the discriminators capacity by lowering the number of layers or the filter sizes this significantly would help gnn when implementing gnn especially with public dataset or otherwise training with noise can be helpful introduce noise to the inputs of the discriminator eg add gaussian noise to the input images to make the discriminators job harder finally latent dimensionality play arround with different dimensions for the latent space eg increase or decrease latentdim training models is all about experimenting with inbuild parameters

78513688,how does the joint probability distribution help to generate things,algorithm machinelearning deeplearning probability probabilitydistribution,here is a simple but real example to illustrate the concepts brown eyes are dominant over blue eyes my grandmother had blue eyes her husband came from a family with only brown eyes as far back as you go my father likewise i had two children with a blueeyed woman lets let x and y be the eye color of those children with the eldest child being y and the younger being x and to discuss the underlying genetics lets use b for the gene for brown eyes and b for blue first lets figure out px y my mother got one gene from her mother and father and so must be bb she had brown eyes my fathers were bb he also had brown eyes depending on what my mother gave me i have even odds of bb and bb whichever one i actually have i have brown eyes i then had children with a blueeyed woman with genes bb if my genes are bb then my children are both bb and will have brown eyes if my genes are bb then each child has even odds of bb and bb independently of each other and therefore my children could come out blue blue blue brown brown blue and brown brown with equal likelihood when you add it up here are the odds we get that is px y lets show how to generate a pair first work out the cumulative probabilities in that order it is now just roll a random number i just got comparing to the cumulative probabilities i got brown brown so thats what i generate funnily enough thats also the real eye colors of my children not a giant coincidence but still what random number corresponds to what output will change if i changed the order in which i list the probabilities but the outputs will come up with the right frequencies no matter how i do it now lets work out px y if you use bayes formula you can verify from this we can figure out what the color of the second childs eyes are likely to be given the color of the first childs eyes this is exactly what we need for a discriminative algorithm but we have absolutely no idea how to tell from these numbers whether a priori the odds of the first child having brown eyes are naive guess or the real answer if they were then our first table would have been obviously this is going to generate a very different distribution than the real one it just happens to give the same pxy and so we need more information for the generative algorithm than the discriminative specifically we need to know py does that clarify things for you

75672816,how does gptlike transformers utilize only the decoder to do sequence generation,deeplearning pytorch gpt textgeneration,the input for a decoderonly model like gpt is typically a sequence of tokens just like in an encoderdecoder model however the difference lies in how the input is processed in an encoderdecoder model the input sequence is first processed by an encoder component that produces a fixedsize representation of the input often called the context vector the context vector is then used by the decoder component to generate the output sequence in contrast in a decoderonly model like gpt there is no separate encoder component instead the input sequence is directly fed into the decoder which generates the output sequence by attending to the input sequence through selfattention mechanisms in both cases the input sequence is typically a sequence of tokens that represent the text data being processed the tokens may be words subwords or characters depending on the specific modeling approach and the granularity of the text data being processed

75366429,why is this deep learning convolutional model not generalizing,deeplearning pytorch convneuralnetwork crossvalidation,ok a few notes which are not an answer per se but are too extended for comments first the fact that your training loss converges to a low value but your validation loss is high means that your model is overfit to the training distribution this could mean your model architecture is not expressive enough to meaningfully distill highlevel information from lowlevel pixelvoxel information so instead learns trainingset wide bias terms that bring the loss relatively low this could indicate that your validation and training split are from different distributions or else that your loss function is not wellchosen for the task your model is too expressive high variance such that it can learn the exact training examples classic overfitting second an almostubiquitous trick for nn training is to use atruntime data augmentation this means that rather then generating a set of augmented images before training you instead generate a set of augmenting functions which apply data transformations randomly this set of functions is used to transform the data batch at each training epoch such that the model never sees exactly the same data example twice third this model architecture is relatively simplistic simpler than alexnet the first modern deep cnn far greater performance has been achieved by making much deeper architectures and using residual layers to see resnet to deal with the vanishing gradient problem id be somewhat surprised if you could achieve good performance on this task with this architecture it is normal for the validation loss to be higher on average than the training loss it is possible that your model is learning to some extent but the loss curve is relatively shallow when compared to the likely overfit training curve i suggest also computing epochwide validation accuracy and reporting this value across epochs you should see training accuracy increase and possibly validation accuracy as well do note that crossvalidation is not quite exactly meant to determine whether the model generalizes to unseen patients that is the purpose of the validation set instead crossvalidation ensures that the training validation performance is valid across multiple data partitions and isnt simply the result of selecting an easy validation set purely for speedsimplicity i recommend training the model first without crossvalidation ie use a single trainingtesting partition once you achieve good performance on the whole dataset you can retrain with kfold to ensure the above but this should make your debug cycles a bit faster

66675299,pytorch onnx tensorflow tflite generates lots of redundant convd operators,tensorflow deeplearning pytorch tensorflowlite onnx,after some additional digging ive found the following my convs were depthwiseconvd is depthwise in pytorch and onnx if it has groups parameter this bunch of convs is an inefficient way of doing a depthwise conv to do it efficiently we need to use tfdepthwiseconv to fix this in onnxtf v you should apply a patch to onnxtf source code posted here in current master branch there is an attempt to fix the issue by detecting depthwise convs but it currently contains a bug to fix the bug in master branch you can apply a fix i posted here ive used the master branch and the fix above resulting in a small graph with depthwise conv ive also created a fork with the fix above so you can do to apply it instead of patching on your own it seems like the issue should be fixed in the next major releaseprobably also consider using as it supports depthwise convolutions and moreover supports full nhwc conversion which allows removing all the transpose ops
66192675,why gan is unable to generate samples from some distributions,python keras deeplearning generativeadversarialnetwork,as you can see from the accuracy plots you have in tensorboard your principal problem here is with the discriminator because its accuracy oscillates around and doesnt improve and this is very bad because the generator is downstream and cant train until the discriminator achieves decent accuracy so what is wrong with the discriminator first it is the way you train it you feed it positive and negative samples in two separate batches this can generate gradients pushing your model coefficients randomly in opposite directions with very poor convergence if you combine both types of samples in a single batch convergence will improve significantly second the batch size random points around a circle is too little for the model to feel the difference against random points you need to have a batch size of at least third the number of neurons in hidden layers actually you have too many neurons for such simple data in both generator and discriminator having too many of them in the discriminator doesnt seem to do much harm but having too many neurons in the generator makes it too unstable the discriminator each time receives different training data and this is one more reason why it fails to train properly if you put and hidden neurons instead of and into the generator it will be much better and the last point it is not only the circular form that makes your circle difficult to learn but also its size it has a radius of and is the saturation value of your generator so it is very easy for it to produce values around and this makes additional trouble for the generator it starts receiving fake data too close to the true data before it achieves decent accuracy to summarize combine true and fake data into a single batch use a larger batch size at least reduce the number of neurons at least in the generator eg to and enjoy the result and one more thing it is better to ask such questions in this community
66127619,understanding of classification report generated from my model,pythonx machinelearning scikitlearn deeplearning neuralnetwork,try using texty is an already n shaped vector with classes and will always give same value for testyargmaxaxis which is equal to thats why your first class has a precision of while the second has a precision of because you have predicted all s correctly predictionsargmaxaxis is a n shaped vector has probability values for class and class you will have to convert it to its classes by taking the argmax so dont change that

65897335,keras data generator predict same number of values,tensorflow keras deeplearning predict kerasrl,when you use a generator you specify a batch size modelpredict will produce batch size number of output predictions if you set steps that is all the predictions you will get to set the steps you should take the number of samples you have and divide it by the batch size for example if you have images with a batch size of then you should set steps equal to ideally you want to go through your test set exactly once the code below will determine the batch size and steps to do that in the code bmax is a value you select that limits the maximum batch size you should set this based on your memory size to avoid a oom out of memory error in the code below parameter length is equal to the number of test samples you have the result will be batchsize steps note if length is a prime number the result will be batchsize and stepslength
65842406,what is keras imagedatagenerator logic,python keras deeplearning,this is not exactly how imagedatagenerator works it does not multiply your data if you dont pass any argument during the instantiation it will just fetch your images from the folder and feed them unspoiled to the network when you add rotationrange widthshiftrange you are instructing the datagenerator to apply random modification to the incoming images within the specified range these are random augmentation during the training they are not pushed after your done with your initial data
65834886,using classweight for imbalancing datafitgenerator,python machinelearning keras deeplearning crossentropy,yes you can use the class weights with categorical cross entropy the weights are applied when the loss function is calculated wrong classifications are penalized according to the weights so the weights are applied neither to validation set nor to test set the idea is then in training time model gives more attention to a class and updates the weights correspondingly that is why in the test or validation time the learned weights will implicitly be biased with respect to class weights the only problem in your code might be the class weights it can be that the weights have to add up to but you should check the library details for this
65661950,keras data augmentation with imagedatagenerator your input ran out of data,tensorflow imageprocessing keras deeplearning dataaugmentation,the fact that imagedatagenerator does not increase the size of the training set all augmentations are done in memory so an original augmented randomly then its augmented version is returned if you want to have a look to augmented images you need set these parameters for the function flowfromdirectory now you have images and with a batch size of you would have steps per epoch but you are trying to have steps which is causing the error if you have a dataset which does not generate batches and want to use all data points then you should set but when you use flowfromdirectory it generates batches so there is no need to set stepsperepoch unless you want to use less data points than generated batches
