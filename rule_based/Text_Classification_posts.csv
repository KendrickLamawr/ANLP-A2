79155290,dutch sentiment analysis robbertje outputs just positivenegative labels netural label is missing,python nlp bertlanguagemodel robertalanguagemodel,this model was trained only on negative and positive labels therefore it will try to categorize every input as positive or negative even if it is nonsensical or neutral what you can do is to find other models that was trained to include neutral label finetune this model on a dataset that includes neutral label empirically define a threshold based on the confidence outputs and interpret it as neutral the first choices are extensive in effort i would suggest you go with the third option for a quick workaround try feeding the model with a few neutral input and observe the range of confidence score in the output then use that threshold to classify as neutral heres a sample
79111733,how to derive attributeslabels from short plain text descriptions ner llm,nlp artificialintelligence largelanguagemodel namedentityrecognition,llm would work nicely for this iv done similar tasks before and it worked nicely with minimal training just keep in mind that any of the statistical methods nlp llm ner will never be accurate but for practical purposes i find llms to be more accurate then a custom soup of regular expressions for you task i would use a framework like langchain and the following prompt note you might need to work on your prompt a bit this just an example when run with a model it will create an xml output which would be trivial to parse you can modify the prompt to create different type of outputs but personally i find xml working very well for me keep in mind that llms are not cheap to run but for this tasks given ambiguousness of the domain it is most likely the best choice for this particular task it would be of a penny per label using openai service you might find a cheaper model provider however when working with llm it is very important to ensure accuracy first then optimize for costs the whole thing will probably take hours to build for the intermediate llm developer if you are learning it may vary but this is a perfect project to learn about llms
78932356,capitalized words in sentiment analysis,nlp sentimentanalysis bertlanguagemodel datapreprocessing,if you are using a bertbased model or any other llm to do the actual classification i would recommend to not use any preprocessing at all at least when it comes to capitalization as these models were pretrained on nonpreprocessed data if you want to then do any kind of analysis on the resulting labeled sentences you could lowercase everything to group ngrams and to simplify the analysis if you are thinking about having multiple classes to have a better distinction between the prediction i think it would make most sense if you switch to a sentiment regression instead of a classification where you predict a value in a continuous range this comes somewhat natural to the finetuning of language models as in a normal classification you would take a continuous output from the model and map it to categorical classes using something like softmax so for your needs you can just skip that last step and directly use the model output many python ml frameworks for finetuning or using language models have their own classes for regression tasks check out this repository as an example

77292726,feeding my classifier one document at a time,python machinelearning scikitlearn nlp tfidfvectorizer,youre going to have two problems doing this vocabulary suppose that in document you have the word eggs in document the word eggs does not appear in order for the vector for and the vector for to have the same meaning the vectorizer for step needs to know to leave an empty column for the word eggs the immediate symptom you see is that the vectors end up having different lengths and numpy cannot represent jagged arrays if you tried to solve this by padding all arrays to the same length you would have the problem that counts representing the same word are assigned to different columns one approach to solving this is to run a countvectorizer over your dataset keeping the vocabulary from each document but throwing away the vector then you use tfidf with a fixed vocabulary representing all words that appear in your dataset this answer describes how to do this inverse document frequency tfidf is term frequency within one document multiplied by inverse document frequency for that term within all documents if you fit this one document at a time youre essentially setting the idf term to in order to compute idf it must have either all documents or at least a count of how many documents have each term in the vocabulary this answer has a library which can deal with this problem i havent personally tried it

77015193,multiclass text classification where classification depends on other columns beside text column,python nlp,that depends on how you would be merging the two simply concatenating might not be the best idea it might be good to introduce a special token between the two strings like the sep or any other token during the training and the inference so that it becomes easier for the model to understand the pattern you can either make a new column with this merged string and use it for your training or merge the text from the two column in your data loader the first option is the easier one if you are interested in playing around with the model you can also try encoding the text from the first column using an encoder like bert then encoding the text from the second column and concatenating the two vectors and feeding it two the classifier head all that said the simple approach of creating a third column with the two texts concatenated with a separator should work fine

76651059,how does placing the output word labels on the initial transitions of the words in an fst lead to effective composition,nlp speechrecognition statemachine finitestateautomaton automaticspeechrecognition,as far as i understand it while the output is determined in the first transition it is only actually produced once a final state is reached so in a way the output is hypothesised and subsequent transitions are used to test the hypothesis if no final state is reached the output so far is discarded on advantage is that multiple paths with identical output the upper path in your example image do not have to repeat the output in every final transition also if you have inputs with similar endings you can merge the paths later which might make the fst more efficient imaging how many english words end in ing or ed or s these can all point to the same identical final states but not if the output is generated at the end i guess a further reason is that this makes it easier to manipulate the fst when it is combined with other fsts it is always easier to push the output generation further backwards if you merge two fsts rather than deal with it when it is already at the end of the path
76571812,multiclass text classification using hugging face models,python nlp huggingfacetransformers huggingface,the main reason why youre not getting the neutral label is because the model that youre using textattackbertbaseuncasedimdb huggingface link here has been trained on the imdb dataset which is binary classification dataset in other words the model only has two final layers and will only output a prediction between two outputs positive or negative you can see more info about the dataset here as you can clearly see its a binary classification dataset so the model trained on it does not allow for different outputs if you pass it three or more labels as you did with negativeneutralpositive it will only consider the first two and ignore the others the model is set such that the first label is negative and the second is positive irrespective of what you set so your neutral is a positive label as it takes the second position even if you set the labels to random words such as hellothere then your hello label will signify a negative score first place and there a positive score second place be careful because if you set your labels to positivenegative then a positive review first item will effectively be negative one this is just how the model youre using is set up hope this makes sense

76097304,wordvec same context word different label,nlp wordvec,regarding your question because the negativesampling candidates are chosen randomly from the whole vocabulary there is always a chance that the center target word here road or the positiveexample nearbycontextword here shimmering will also be chosen as negative examples in a tiny toysized example like this with a total vocabulary of just words that chance is pretty high by contrast in typical vocabularies of tens to hundredsofthousands of words which are required to have a model that really works rather than just illustrates the process such random picks of the target or positive word are very rare but in practice this has negligible effect on the final results the positive word shimmering often wont be in the negative examples and even when it is its appearance as the positive example will on net still nudge its vector differently than the other negativeexamples and in a realisticallysized training corpus with many examples of each words usage in context and with multiple training epochs its even less of a problem even if the intended positive example appears by bad luck many times among the randomlydrawn negative examples overall the necessary meaninginfluenced distinguishing updates to the model still happen so typical implementations dont even worry about the rare cases where the same positive word is drawn as a negative example as well to try to check for and special handle that rare case is more expensive than any theoretical slight benefit it could offer also note road is a perfectly legitimate negative example for a center target word road most words dont appear near themselves and for the few that do the road road skipgram will appear many times tugging the road vector appropriately regarding your question typical fullfeatured wordvec implementations do essentially weight nearer words more heavily but in a somewhat nonintuitive way for efficiency no matter what window size youve specified the actual window that it uses for a given center target word will be some random value from to the window size youve chosen that is for a window it will actually sometimes use an effective value of window and sometimes window and sometimes window this ensures that the immediate nearestneighbors are always used for skipgram pairs while those that are a full window positions away are only used window of the time this has roughly the same effect over many texts epochs as if they were each assigned a scaling factor but by performing less calculation rather than more calculation every position every time with a multiplicative scaling factor the original wordvecc reference code from the google researchers who published the wordvec algorithm did this calling the effective reduced window value b and the python gensim library reimplementation based on that code keeps these effectivewindow values in a array called reducedwindows id guess that tensorflow wordvec implementations that are more complete also do this as youve noted this small illustrative tutorial which notes at its top that it is not an exact implementation of the usual approach doesnt seem to do any such weighting via dynamicwindowshrinking or otherwise where such windowshrinking is used its used for both the skipgram and continuousbagofwords modes update regarding your comment questions about ordering issues note that data thats not real natural language text like say lists of coordered products may not have the same tokenfrequency distributions cooccurrence patterns as naturallanguage the initial writtenup uses evaluations were mainly on real naturallanguage text so while wordvec has since been shown to often work well on such other tokenstreams remember its a bit of a different domain that examples that use meaningful naturallanguage sentencesparagraphsetc so may benefit from trying quite different parameters in particular early wordvec implelmentations hardcoded the negativesampling exponent parameter at a value of which workd well in the early naturallangauge experiments in the article you link this parameter is named but in gensim its called nsexponent theres been work footnote in the article you link suggesting that in other domains like recommendation values very different from may be better even negative values both worked better on some of that papers evaluations than the old hardcoded default i say all this to highlight if working with naturallanguage you may not want to tinker with nsexponent much if at all but using wordvec further afield trying a wider range of values makes sense as you note for tokens where ordering isnt meaningful perhaps because the logsdb returned them in some random or sorted order thats arbitrary with respect to the original generating users actual actions you also might make different choices for window other parameters for example gensims recent versions offer a shrinkwindows parameter that with its default true value does the usual dynamic shrinking of effective windows to essentially weight nearer words higher if in your data youre sure the nearness of tokens is truly irrelevant you can set shrinkwindowsfalse and the full window size will be used every time and if you set window to be some number larger tha twice your largest text in token count youd ensure that for each text every word is always in every other words context window if your texts are long that could be expensive but it may also better truly match the meaning of your tokensets now with regard to the choice of cbow or skipgram both of them are influenced by word nearness whether words appear within the window or not and in the default shrinkwindowstrue also whether theyre nearneighbors or fartherneighbors but neither are sensitive to exact orderings in a manner that really learns anything from phrases or grammar while one or the other might work better or faster under certain conditions neither is inherently more orderingoblivious than the other if you have time a way to score them against each other they could both be worth trying and evaluating against each other but none is necessarily better on st principles the article likely just picked skipgram because it usually does ok is probably a little simpler to explain it wasnt interested in discussingchecking both modes finally if your tokensets dont have a meaningful ordering but might have been given some forced order say by an alphabetical sort as part of prepping the corpus and if either you leave nearerwieghting on or use a window value smalelr than any of your tokensets then your model may learn spurious associations for example two alphabeticallynear productnames would appear more often in each others contextwindows or be have disproportionate influence on each other by their artifical processcreated nearness the two different ways to fight this are to either ensure the windows are large enough an shrinkwindows is off that to the algorithm all tokens in a single text are equallynear or randomlyshuffle the tokens inside each text at least once before training so that even windows that dont cover the whole tesxt arent oversampling falseassociations this was a lengthier explanation of the the same considerion that your linked article mentions as an additional theoretical note in the window size section

71710186,creating word embedings from bert and feeding them to random forest for classification,machinelearning nlp datascience classification bertlanguagemodel,regarding the no improvements despite adding more features some researchers believe that the bert word embeddings already contain all the available information presented in text so then it doesnt matter how fancy a classification head you add to it doesnt matter if it is a linear model that uses the embeddings or a complicated ml algorithm with a number of other features they will not provide significant improvements in many tasks they argue that since bert is a contextaware bidirectional language model that is trained extensively on mlm and nsp tasks it already grasps most of the things that additional features for punctuation wordvec and tfidf could convey the lexicon could probably help a little in the sentiment task if it is relevant but the one or two extra variables that you likely use to represent it probably get drowned in all the other features other than that the accuracy of bertbased models depends on the dataset used sometimes the data is simply too diverse to obtain a perfect score eg if there are some instances of observations that are very similar but with different class labels etc you can see in the bert papers that the accuracy widely depends on the task eg in some tasks it is indeed but for some tasks eg masked language modeling where the model needs to choose a particular word from a vocab of over k words the accuracy of could be impressive in some cases so in order to obtain a reliable comparison with bert papers youd need to pick a dataset that theyve used and then compare regarding the dataset balance for deep learning models in general the rule of thumb is that the training set should be more or less balanced wrt the fraction of data covered by each class label so if you have labels should be if labels then each should be at around of training dataset etc that is because most nns work in batches where they update the model weights based on the feedback from each batch so if you have too many values of one class the batch updates will be dominated by that one class effectively worsening the quality of your training so if you want to improve the accuracy of your model balancing the dataset could be an easy fix and if you have eg ordered classes with differing sizes you may consider merging some of them eg reviews from as bad as neutral as good and then rebalancing if still necessary unless its a situation where eg class has of data and classes share the remaining in such a case you should probably consider some more advanced options such as partitioning the algo to two parts one predicting whether or not an instance is in class so a binary classifier the other to distinguish between the underrepresented classes

71339209,nltk adding negative words for sentiment analysis,machinelearning nlp artificialintelligence nltk,how are you doing the sentiment analysis so far it would help to see samples to know what exactly you are trying to do if you are using some kind of trained model that gives you a sentiment value or sentiment class then it definitely isnt as simple as just telling the model to see those words as negative you would have to retrainfinetune the model of course you could mix the results of the model with your own postediting of the results by checking if there are certain words in the text and if so rate it even lower than the model rating in general i am pretty sure that a trained model yields a better performance than anything rulebased you could build yourself depending if you have available data the best performance would probably be to finetune a pretrained model but for this nltk and spacy arent the bestmost user friendly edit some ways to run toxicity analysis models trained to detect toxicity the most powerful and stateoftheart way to do this analysis would probably be to used pretrained transformer models which were finetuned on the probably best annotated available dataset for this topic which is the one released for the jigsaw toxicity detection challenges in python you can find some models for this on huggingface eg there you also have an api to see how it works and what the model can detect purely rulebased since you have a list of slurs you are probably expected to use more of a rulebased approach a basic approach for assigning a toxicity value to a sentence would be split the tweet into sentences using nltks senttokenize then split each sentence into words using wordtokenize set all words to lowercase count how many toxic words are in the sentence the number of toxic word occurences is the profanity score of that sentence mix rulebased and sentiment analysis since your approach so far seems to be to use a sentiment analysis module you could try to mix the sentiment score you get from nltks sentiment analysis modulevader module with a rule based approach that counts the number of words from the list you should realize that sentiment analysis is not the same as profanity or toxicity detection though if you give something like i am extremely sad to nltks sentiment analysis it will return a very negative score even though the sentence has no profanity or toxicity on the other hand if you give something like i am so fucking happy to the sentiment analysis it will at least detect that this is not too negative which is a benefit compared to a purely rule based approach which would mark this as profanitytoxicity so it makes sense to combine the approaches but doesnt make much sense to just insert the list you have into the sentiment analysis what you could do for example is weight each score as of the overall score first you calculate the sentiment score and then you apply your own rulebased score as described before onto that score to make it lower if any of the slurs occur

68009571,naive gaussian predict probability only returns or,python machinelearning scikitlearn nlp datascience,let me reproduce your results on a public newsgroups dataset for simplicity i will use only two groups and only observations now lets train a model i will use a pipeline to stack together all algorithms in a single processor in fact not all predicted probabilities are or but most of them are the average predicted probability of the predicted class is so the model is on average very confident in its predictions we see that accuracy on the training set is perfect but the accuracy on the test set is only so it seems that our gaussiannb is overfitting that is it relies too much on the training dataset yes this is possible even with such a simple algorithm as nb if the feature space is large and with countvectorizer each word in the vocabulary is a separate feature and the number of all possible words is quite large so our model is overfitting and thats why it is producing overconfident predictions consisting of zeros and ones and as usual we can fight overfitting using regularization with gaussiannb the simplest way to regularize your model is to set the parameter varsmoothing to some relatively large positive value by default it is from my experience i suggest values in the range from to here i set it to this means that of the variance of the most diverse features ie the words that are distributed most evenly between the classes will be added to all the other features we can see that after adding regularization the predictions of our model have become less confident the average confidence is instead of moreover the accuracy on the test set has improved because this overconfidence has caused the model to make some incorrect predictions the logic of these incorrect predictions can be illustrated as follows without regularization the model fully relies on the frequency of the words in the training set and when it seems eg a text the probability of dying from xrays the model thinks i have seen the word dying only in the texts about atheism so this must be a text about atheism but this is a text about space and a more regularized model will not be so certain in its conclusions and will still reserve some small but nonzero probability that a text with the word dying is about some topic other than atheism so the lesson here is whatever learning algorithm you use find out how to regularize it and tune the regularization parameter thoughtfully

67795761,how to properly build a sgdclassifier with both text and numerical data using featureunion and pipeline,python machinelearning scikitlearn nlp pipeline,the main problem is the way you are returning the numeric values xnumbervalues will return an array of shape nsamples which the featureunion object will try to combine with the result of the transformation of the text features later on in your case the dimension of the transformed text features is nsamples which cannot be combined with the vector you get for the numeric features an easy fix would be to reshape the vector into a d array with dimensions nsamples like the following def getnumericdatax return xnumbervaluesreshape note that i removed the brackets surrounding the expression as they unnecessarily wrapped the result in a list while the above will make your code run there are still a couple of things about your code that are not quite efficient and can be improved first is the expression record for record in xtextvalues which is redundant as xtextvalues would already be enough the only difference is that the former is a list object whereas the latter is a numpy ndarray which is usually preferred second is what ben reiniger already stated in his comment featureunion is meant to perform several transformations on the same data and combine the results into a single object however it appears that you simply want to transform the text features separately from your numeric ones in this case the columntransformer offers a much simpler and canonical way combinedclf pipeline transformer columntransformer vectorizer pipeline vect vect tfidf tfidf scaler scl text remainderpassthrough clf sgdclassifierrandomstate maxiterint lenxtrain shuffletrue what happens above is that columntransformer only selects the text column and passes it to the pipeline of transformations and will eventually merge it with the numeric column that was just passed through note that it becomes obsolete to define your own selectors as columntransformer will take care of that by specifying the columns to be transformed by each transformer see the documentation for more information

64704461,open source pretrained models for taxonomygeneral word classification,machinelearning nlp classification wordembedding,sounds like wordnet would be a good fit for this task wordnet is a lexical database that organises words in a hierarchical tree structure like a taxonomy and contains additional semantic information for many words see eg wordnet for cat here for a browserbased demo a word thats one hierarchy level above another word is a so called hypernym the hypernym for cat is eg feline with wordnet in nltk you can get the hypernyms of two words until you get the same hypernym for cat and dog the common hypernym is animal see example code here you ask for a machine learning solution in your question a classical approach would be word vectors via gensim but they will not give you a clear common category based on a database created by experts like wordnet but just give you words that often occur next to your target words cat dog in the training data i think that machine learning is not necessarily the best tool here see example

64684506,transformers get named entity prediction for words instead of tokens,nlp pytorch huggingfacetransformers,there are two questions here annotating token classification a common sequential tagging especially in named entity recognition follows the scheme that a sequence to tokens with tag x at the beginning gets bx and on reset of the labels it gets ix the problem is that most annotated datasets are tokenized with space for example where o indicates that it is not a namedentity bartist is the beginning of the sequence of tokens labelled as artist and iartist is inside the sequence similar pattern for medium at the moment i posted this answer there is an example of ner in huggingface documentation here the example doesnt exactly answer the question here but it can add some clarification the similar style of named entity labels in that example could be as follows adapt tokenizations with all that said about annotation schema bert and several other models have different tokenization model so we have to adapt these two tokenizations in this case with bertbaseuncased the expected outcome is like this in order to get this done you can go through each token in original annotation then tokenize it and add its label again when you add cls and sep in the tokens their labels o must be added to labels with the code above it is possible to get into a situation that a beginning tag like bartist get repeated when the beginning word splits into pieces according to the description in huggingface documentation you can encode these labels with to be ignored something like this should work

64606333,bert embeddings in sparknlp or bert for token classification in huggingface,nlp bertlanguagemodel huggingfacetransformers johnsnowlabssparknlp,to answer your question no hugging face uses different head for different tasks this is almost the same as what the authors of bert did with their model they added taskspecific layer on top of the existing model to finetune for a particular task one thing that must be noted here is that when you add task specific layer a new layer you jointly learn the new layer and update the existing learnt weights of the bert model so basically your bert model is part of gradient updates this is quite different from obtaining the embeddings and then using it as input to neural nets question when you obtain the embeddings and use it for another complex model i am not sure how to quantify in terms of loosing the information because you are still using the information obtained using bert from your data to build another model so we cannot attribute to loosing the information but the performance need not be the best when compared with learning another model on top of bert and along with bert often people would obtain the embeddings and then as input to another the classifier due to resource constraint where it may not be feasible to train or finetune bert

64119521,dutch sentiment analysis using r,r nlp,sentiment analysis using a dictionary is basically just a pattern matching task i think this becomes clear when using the tidytext package and reading the book about it so i wouldnt bother with such a complex setup here instead i would convert the dictionary they are using which is from here into a dataframe and then use tidytext unfortunately the dictionary is stored in xml format and im not very familiar with that so the code looks a little hacky but the output is correct for the purpose now we can use the functions from tidytext and the broader tidyverse to lookup the words in the dictionary and attach the score to each word summarise is used to get exactly one value per text thats also why you need the textid as i said more on this and nlp is explained on tidytextminingcom so dont worry if this looks complicated to you now

64068144,nlp difference between using nltks sentiment analysis and using ml approach,python machinelearning nlp nltk sentimentanalysis,sentimentintensityanalyzer is a tool built specifically for analyzing sentiment it is easy to use but can miss some cases for example a machine learning approach like the one outlined in your link more involved it focuses on creating features often using tfidf but certainly not limited to and then a machine learning is used on top of that this approach relies on availability of good enough and large enough training dataset often feature extraction is the more important part and a simple model like logistic regression is chosen bert is pretrained model that can be fine tuned thought it doesnt have to be i found that fine tuning helps in my experience the main advantages of bert with enough training data bert can be very powerful with enough training data it should be able to get an example in the beginning of my post correctly and this is a huge advantage since bert is already pretrained it might require relatively small number of training samples to give good reasonable results because bert does not require or require a lot less feature engineering it can be fast in terms of ml engineering work to get good initial results the main limitations of bert are learning curve mostly conceptually understanding how it works using bert is not very hard bert is slow to train and predict you pretty much have to use at least a moderate gpu even for a small dataset lack of transparency it is really hard to know why bert based model is suggesting what it is suggesting

63672169,huggingface transformers model for german news classification,python nlp textclassification bertlanguagemodel huggingfacetransformers,you dont need to look for a specific text classification model when your classes are completely different because most listed models used one of the base models and finetuned the base layers and trained the output layers for their needs in your case you will remove the output layers and their finetuning of the base layers will not benefit or hurt you much sometimes they have extended the vocabulary which could be beneficial for your task but you have to check description which is often sparse and the vocabulary by yourself to get more details about the respective model in general i recommend you to work with one of the base models right away and only look for other models in case of insufficient results the following is an example for bert with classes from transformers import bertforsequenceclassification berttokenizer tokenizer berttokenizerfrompretrainedbertbasegermandbmdzuncased model bertforsequenceclassificationfrompretrainedbertbasegermandbmdzuncased numlabels
63666851,multilabel classification implementation,python tensorflow keras nlp kaggle,the loss function to be used is indeed the binarycrossentropy with a sigmoid activation the categoricalcrossentropy is not suitable for multilabel problems because in case of the multilabel problems the labels are not mutually exclusive repeat the last sentence the labels are not mutually exclusive this means that the presence of a label in the form is correct the categoricalcrossentropy and softmax will always tend to favour one specific class but this is not the case just like you saw a comment can be both toxic and obscene now imagine photos with cats and dogs inside them what happens if we have dogs and cats inside a photo is it a dog picture or a cat picture it is actually a both picture we definitely need a way to specify that multiple labels are pertainedrelated to a photolabel the rationale for using the binarycrossentropy and sigmoid for multilabel classification resides in the mathematical properties in that each output needs to be treated as in independent bernoulli distribution therefore the only correct solution is bce sigmoid

61638870,multilingual freetextitems text classification for improving a recommender system,nlp multilingual textclassification unsupervisedlearning supervisedlearning,can i use supervised learning if i consider the fact that the descriptions are in multiple languages yes this is not a problem except it makes your data more sparse if you actually only have characters is that not words per item you may not have enough data also the main challenge for supervised learning will be whether you have labels for the data if yes are classic approaches like multinomial naive bayes or svm suitable they will work as well as they always have though these days building a vector representation is probably a better choice if i want to improve the first model in case it is not performing well and use unsupervised multilingual emdedding to build a classifier how can i train this classifier on the numerical labels later assuming the numerical labels are labels on the original data you can add them as tokens like label and the model can learn representations of them if you want to make an unsupervised recommender honestly these days i wouldnt start with naive bayes or classical models id go straight to word vectors as a first test for clustering using fasttext or wordvec is pretty straightforward the main problem is that if you really only have characters per item that just might not be enough data to cluster usefully
61520426,can i use vadersentiment to calculate polarity and subjectivity on language other than english,python nlp sentimentanalysis,according to the documentation vader uses two resources a dictionary of tokens with their sentiment ratings a set of syntactic rules that define the relationships between words while you can create your own resources for other languages but the authors state that manually creating much less validating a comprehensive sentiment lexicon is a labor intensive and sometimes error prone process so while possible it wont be easy the lexicon file that comes with vader comprises just shy of entries i dont know how easy it is to generate these presumably there is a tradeoff between quickly achieving broad coverage and accuracy of the results perhaps you can go for coverage first and then gradually improve accuracy by modifying the entries accordingly the syntactic rules from a cursory glance mainly seem to describe adverbs and whether they increase or decrease the sentiment again this is something that would have to be adjusted as its hardcoded for english in the source file it depends how different your target language is grammatically from english how easy or difficult that task will be
61350737,is it possible to finetune bert to do retweet prediction,machinelearning nlp bertlanguagemodel,you can finetune bert and you can use bert to do retweet prediction but you need more architecture in order to predict if user i will retweet tweet j here is an architecture off the top of my head at a high level create a dense vector representation embedding of user i perhaps containing something about the users interests such as sports create an embedding of tweet j create an embedding of the combination of the first two embeddings together such as with concatenation or hadamard product feed this embedding through a nn that performs binary classification to predict retweet or nonretweet lets break this architecture down by item to create an embedding of user i you will need to create some kind of neural network that accepts whatever features you have about the user and produces a dense vector this part is the most difficult component of the architecture this area is not in my wheelhouse but a quick google search for user interest embedding brings up this research paper on an algorithm called starspace it suggests that it can obtain highly informative user embeddings according to user behaviors which is what you want to create an embedding of tweet j you can use any type of neural network that takes tokens and produces a vector research prior to would have suggested using an lstm or a cnn to produce the vector however bert as you mentioned in your post is the current stateoftheart it takes in text or text indices and produces a vector for each token one of those tokens should have been the prepended cls token which commonly is taken to be the representation of the whole sentence this article provides a conceptual overview of the process it is in this part of the architecture that you can finetune bert this webpage provides concrete code using pytorch and the huggingface implementation of bert to do this step ive gone through the steps and can vouch for it in the future youll want to google for bert single sentence classification to create an embedding representing the combination of user i and tweet j you can do one of many things you can simply concatenate them together into one vector so if user i is an mdimensional vector and tweet j is an ndimensional vector then the concatenation produces an mndimensional vector an alternative approach is to compute the hadamard product elementwise multiplication in this case both vectors must have the same dimension to make the final classification of retweet or notretweet build a simple nn that takes the combination vector and produces a single value here since you are doing binary classification a nn with a logistic sigmoid function would be appropriate you can interpret the output as the probability of retweeting so a value above would be to retweet see this webpage for basic details on building a nn for binary classification in order to get this whole system to work you need to train it all together endtoend that is you have to get all the pieces hooked up first and train it rather than training the components separately your input dataset would look something like this if you want an easier route where there is no user personalization then just leave out the components that create an embedding of user i you can use bert to build a model to determine if the tweet is retweeted without regard to user you can again follow the links i mentioned above

61187520,should decoder prediction be detached in pytorch training,python nlp pytorch,yes you should detach it detaching a tensor removes it from the computational graph so its no longer tracked in respect to the gradient calculations which is exactly what you want since the previous token can be seen as a constant defining the starting point it will be discarded after one time step however if you dont detach it it will still be hanging around since its tracked in the computational graph which consumes unnecessary memory realistically the memory overhead is usually rather small so you would only notice it if you have a lot of time steps and are at the upper limit of your gpu memory usage just regard it as a microoptimisation there are instances where you absolutely need to detach a tensor to avoid unwanted backpropagation but that generally happens when the same input is used in two different models since backward consumes the graph by default and if two different backpropagations try to go through the same path it wont be available anymore and fail

60793449,how does wordvec predicts the word correctly but the actual dataset does not contain it,python nlp wordvec,the skipgram model is working like the question of filling the blank for example there are two twitter data its summer now today is its now today is hot its winter now today is its now today is cold by training a model to predict the blank the model learns that the representations of these two words either cold and winter or hot and summer should be closer at the same time it also learns that the distance between cold and summer should be increased because when the context contains cold the blank is more likely to be winter which in turn suppresses the possibility of being summer thus even though there is no one data containing cold and summer the model still can learn the relationship between these two words this is my humble opinion on skipgram please feel free to discuss
60693882,can tensor flow be used for unsupervised learning for solving nlp classification,tensorflow nlp unsupervisedlearning,tensorflow isnt a complete solution by itself its a set of tools that come together to help solve problems relying on high computational workloads like unsupervised deep learning these tools are optimized to help solve some of the complex mathematics that deep learning requires unsupervised nlp learning problems typically comprise clustering sorting based on unique attributes anomaly detection association mining or feature reduction if these are what you meant in your question then deep learning via tensorflow tools can certainly help you with your problem if you meant classification as in the mapping of inputs to a limited set of outputs then this is a supervised ie labeled learning problem tools like tensorflow and pytorch can still help in supervised learning scenarios the objective is just different

60537187,starspace what is the interpretation of the labeldoc fileformat,facebook nlp wordembedding,the way starspace uses the labels highly depends on the trainmode you are using the labeldoc format is useful when you go for a trainmode that just relies on labels trainmode through where it may be the same thing to use a fasttext format specifying the label prefix but some trainmodes benefit from labeldoc format ie trainmode or to use a whole sentence as a label element for that trainmode so to clarify that if you are performing a text classification taskas explained in this example labeldoc wouldnt have any input recognized but on the other hand as you stated using fasttext format will breakdown all nonlabeled text as input and learn to predict the label tags and an example for labeldoc format would be developing a content based recommender system as explained in this example every tab separated sentence is used at lhs or rhs during training time but if you go on a collaborative approach the content of the articles or wherever you sentences come from is not taken in account it can be trained either with fasttext specifying the label prefix or labeldoc file format as labels are picked randomly during training time for lhs or rhs this second example is explained here

58891402,how to identify words with the same meaning in order to reduce number of tagscategoriesclasses in a dataset,nlp dataset spacy,i dont know that there is a standard solution but i can suggest a couple of approaches ranked by increasing depth of knowledge or going from the surface form to the meaning string matching lemmatisationstemming word embedding vector distance string matching is based on the calculating the difference between strings as a measure of how many characters they share or how many editing steps it takes to transform one into the other levenshtein distance is one of the most common ones however depending on the size of your data it might be a bit inefficient to use this is a really cool approach to find most similar strings in a large data set however it might not be the most suitable one for your particular data set as your similarities seem more semantic and less bound to the surface form of the words lemmatisationstemming goes beyond the surface by analysing the words apart based on their morphology in your example gaming and games both have the same stem game so you could base your similarity measure on matching stems this can be better than pure string matching as you can see that go and went are related word embeddings go beyond the surface form by encoding meaning as the context in which words appear and as such might find a semantic similarity between health and fitness that is not apparent from the surface at all the similarity is measured as the cosine distancesimilarity between two word vectors which is basically the angle between the two vectors it seems to me that the third approach might be most suitable for your data

58582301,prediction is identical for all input data in multilabel classification nlp,python keras deeplearning nlp,did you check for the class distribution in your training data accuracy is not a good measure when you have strongly imbalanced classes for instance if these genres make up of your training data the model may not have learned how to classify any other genre but still achieve accuracy a common failure mode is constant output which may still have a high accuracy with imbalanced classes so the first step should be to look at the number of training movies in the respective categories if my hunch is correct you may try looking into class balancing weights or into other loss functions that essentially also give more weight to rare classes you may also want to finetune your model without class weights after it has learned to classify all genres in order to learn the real prior probabilities

56641691,what are the purposes of each step in trainevaluatepredict in tensorflow,tensorflow machinelearning nlp,training evaluation and prediction are the three main steps of training a model basically in any ml framework and to move a model from researchdevelopment to production training a suitable ml architecture is selected based on the problem which needs to be solved hyperparameter optimization is carried out to finetune the model the model is then trained on the data for a certain number of epochs metrics such as loss accuracy mse are monitored evaluation we need to move the model to production the model in the production stage will only make inferences and hence we require the best model possible so in order to evaluate or test the model based on some predefined levels the evaluation phase is carried out evaluation is mostly carried out on the data which is a subset of the original dataset training and evaluations splits are made while preprocessing the data metrics are calculated in order to check the performance of the model on the evaluation dataset the evaluation data has been never seen by the model as it is not trained on it hence the models best performance is expected here prediction after the testing of the model we can move it to production in the production phase models only make an inference predictions on the data given to them no training takes place here even after a thorough examination the model tends to make mispredictions hence in the production stage we can receive interactive feedback from the users about the performance of the model now but what is the purpose of the evaluation step what is it supposed to do how is that different from the prediction phase evaluation is to make the model better for most cases through which it will come across predictions are made to check for other problems which are not related to performance

54850657,intent classification with large number of intent classes,python tensorflow nlp textclassification,first wordvec and glove are almost dead you should probably consider using more recent embeddings like bert or elmo both of which are sensitive to the context in other words you get different embeddings for the same word in a different context currently bert is my own preference since its completely opensource and available gpt was released a couple of days ago which is apparently a little bit better but its not completely available to the public second when you use berts pretrained embeddings your model has the advantage of seeing a massive amount of text google massive and thus can be trained on small amounts of data which will increase its performance drastically finally if you could classify your intents into some coarsegrained classes you could train a classifier to specify which of these coarsegrained classes your instance belongs to then for each coarsegrained class train another classifier to specify the finegrained one this hierarchical structure will probably improve the results also for the type of classifier i believe a simple fully connected layer on top of bert would suffice

53623432,understanding word embeddings convolutional layer and max pooling layer in lstms and rnns for nlp text classification,python tensorflow nlp lstm wordembedding,the simplest way to understand a convolution is to think of it as a mapping that tells a neural network to which features pixels in the case of where you would use a d convolution or words before or after a given word for text where you would use a d convolution are nearby without this the network has no way of knowing that words just before or just after a given word are more relevant than words that are much further away it typically also results in information being presented in a much more densely packed format thereby greatly reducing the number of parameters in your case down from million to thousand i find that this answer explains the technicality of how it works rather well max pooling is a method that downsamples your data it is often used directly after convolutions and achieves two things it again reduces the number of parameters in your case it will represent four values with a single value the max of the four values it does this by taking the first four values then taking a stride of size four and taking the next four values etc in other words there will be no overlap between the pools this is what keras does by default but you could also set the stride to for example secondly because it takes the max value in theory in sharpens the contrast between the pools by taking the maximum value instead of for example taking the average max pooling is not learnt it is just a simple arithmetic calculation that is why the number of parameters is given as zero the same for dropout an lstm expects a three dimensional input of shape number of samples number of timesteps number of features having performed the previous convolution and max pooling steps youve reduced the representation of your initial embedding to number of timesteps and number of features the first value number of samples none is a placeholder for the batch size you plan to use by initializing an lstm with units also known as hidden states you are parameterizing the size of the memory of the lstm essentially the accumulation of its input output and forget gates through time

52724444,need help in creating an appropriate model to predict semantic similarity between two sentences,python machinelearning nlp datamodeling wordvec,your general approach is reasonable an average of the wordvectors in a sentence often works ok as a rough summary vector of the sentence there are many other possible techniques which might do better but thats a good easy start you can use someone elses pretrained wordvectors but if you have a good large training set of text from your domain those wordvectors may work better you should look for a tutorial on how to train your own wordvectors with gensim for example therea a demo jupyter notebook wordvecipynb included with it in its docsnotebooks directory which you can also view online at your current avgfeaturevector function has a number of problems in particular if you pass in the model it already includes within it the fixed indexword list and an alreadydetermined numberofdimensions so no need to pass those in redundantly youre looping over all words in the model rather than just the ones in your sentence so not calculating just based on your sentence there are better more pythonic ways to do the various array math operations youre attempting including in the numpy library a simple mean function that will spare you the addingdividing of creating the average you may want to fix those problems as an exercise but you could also use utility methods on the wordvectors model instead in particular look at nsimilarity it specifically takes two setsofwords automatically averages each set then reports the similarityvalue closer to for moresimilar closer to for leastsimilar between the two sets see so if you had two sentences as strings in sent and sent and a set of wordvectors either justtrained by you or loaded from elsewhere in kvmodel you could get the sentences similarity via you might still get errors if any of the wordtokens arent known by the model whether you actually create average vectors for different sentences and store them in some listdictdataframeetc or simply remember the pairwisesimilarities somewhere will depend on what you want to do next and after you have the basics working on this simple measure of textsimilarity you could look into other techniques for example another way to compare two texts using wordvectors but not via the simple average is called word movers distance its quite a bit slower to calculate though another technique for collapsing texts into a single vector for the purposes of comparison is available in gensim as docvec it works a lot like wordvec but also creates vectorsperlongertext instead of just vectorsperindividualword

50171512,how to predict probability of a sentence,nlp stanfordnlp probability hiddenmarkovmodels markovmodels,a pcfg defines i a distribution over parse trees and ii a distribution over sentences the probability of a parse tree given by a pcfg is where the parse tree t is described as a multiset of rules r it is a multiset because a rule can be used several times to derive a tree to compute the probability of a sentence you have to consider every possible way of deriving the sentence and sum over their probabilities where means that the string of terminals the yield of t is the sentence s in your example the probability of what is a cat is because you cannot generate it with your grammar heres another example with a toy grammar the sentence they can fish has two possible parse trees with probabilities and so its probability is the sum or probabilities of both parse trees it turns out that in the general case it is too computationally expensive to enumerate each possible parse tree for a sentence however there is a on algorithm to compute the sum efficiently the insideoutside algorithm see pages pdf by michael collins edit corrected trees

49738313,how to predict word using trained cbow,neuralnetwork nlp deeplearning wordvec languagemodel,wordvec cbow mode typically uses symmetric windows around a target word but it simply averages the current intraining wordvectors for all words in the window to find the inputs for the prediction neuralnetwork thus it is tolerant of asymmetric windows if there are fewer words are available on either side fewer words on that side are used and perhaps even zero on that side for words at the frontend of a text additionally during each training example it doesnt always use the maximumwindow specified but some randomsized window upto the specified size so for window it will sometimes use just on either side and other times or this is done to effectively overweight closer words finally and most importantly for your question wordvec doesnt really do a fullprediction during training of what exact word does the model say should be heat this target location in either the hierarchical softmax or negativesampling variants such an exact prediction can be expensive requiring calculations of neuralnetwork outputnode activation levels proportionate to the size of the full corpus vocabulary instead it does the muchsmaller numberofcalculations required to see how strongly the neuralnetwork is predicting the actual target word observed in the training data perhaps in contrast to a few other words in hierarchicalsoftmax this involves calculating output nodes for a short encoding of the one target word ignoring all other output nodes encoding other words in negativesampling this involves calculating the one distinct output node for the target word plus a few output nodes for other randomlychosen words the negative examples in neither case does training know if this target word is being predicted in preference over all other words because its not taking the time to evaluate all others words it just looks at the current strengthofoutputs for a real examples target word and nudges them via backpropagation to be slightly stronger the end result of this process is the wordvectors that are usefullyarranged for other purposes where similar words are close to each other and even certain relative directions and magnitudes also seem to match human judgements of words relationships but the final wordvectors and modelstate might still be just mediocre at predicting missing words from texts because it was only ever nudged to be better on individual examples you could theoretically compare a models predictions for every possible target word and thus forcecreate a sort of rankedlist of predictedwords but thats more expensive than anything needed for training and prediction of words like that isnt the usual downstream application of sets of wordvectors so indeed most wordvec libraries dont even include any interface methods for doing full targetword prediction for example the original wordvecc from google doesnt a few versions ago the python gensim library added an experimental method for prediction predictoutputword it only works for negativesampling mode and it doesnt quite handle windowwordweighting the same way as is done in training you could give it a try but dont be surprised if the results arent impressive as noted above making actual predictions of words isnt the usual real goal of wordvectraining other more stateful textanalysis even just large cooccurrence tables might do better at that but they might not force wordvectors into interesting constellations like wordvec

48484826,how to handle naive bayes classifier when keywords are not present in training set,python nlp nltk textclassification naivebayes,it sounds like the naive bayes classifier is doing the right thing namely trying to estimate the conditional probability distribution of classes when given some input features if there arent any input features that match your training data your case then its correct that the output conditional probability distribution is flat in your case that means that case no usable input features is equivalent to case input features that are present but dont discriminate at all between fruit and vegetables if you wanted to distinguish the two cases it might be helpful to look at the prior probability of your input features this would show that case looks much more like your training data than case which presumably has no features in common with your training data depending on how your nbc is constructed that prior probability might be strictly zero or assigned some small value to avoid the risk of calculating a logprobability that is singular
48335460,why did nltk naivebayes classifier misclassify one record,nlp classification nltk sentimentanalysis naivebayes,this particular failure is because your wordfeats function expects a list of words a tokenized sentence but you pass it each word separately so wordfeats iterates over its letters youve built a classifier that classifies strings as positive or negative on the basis of the letters they contain youre probably in this predicament because you pay no attention to what you name your variables in your main loop none of the variables sentence words or word contain what their name claims to understand and improve your program start by naming things properly bugs aside this is not how you build a sentiment classifier the training data should be a list of tokenized sentences each labeled with its sentiment not a list of individual words similarly you classify tokenized sentences

47886227,can i train my classifier multiple times,python scikitlearn nlp nltk trainingdata,the way youre doing it right now will actually just overwrite the classifier for each chunk in your training data as youre creating a new sklearnclassifier object each time what you need to do is instantiate the sklearnclassifier prior to getting into the training loop however looking at the code here it appears that the nltk sklearnclassifier uses the fit method of the underlying sklearn model this means that you cant actually update a model once it is trained what you need to do is instantiate the sklearn model directly and use the partialfit method something like this should work at the end youll have a multinomialnb classifier that has been trained on each chunk of your data typically if the whole dataset will fit in memory it is somewhat more performant to just download the whole thing and call fit once in which case you could actually use the nltk sklearnclassifier see the notes about the partialfit method here however if you are unable to fit the entire set in memory it is certainly common practice to train on chunks of the data you can do this by making several calls to the database or by extracting all of the information from the database placing it in a csv on your hard drive and reading chunks of it from there note if youre using a shared database with other users the dbas may prefer you to extract all of it at once as once as this would probably take up fewer db resources than making several separate smaller calls to the database would

44132313,can the anew dictionary be used for sentiment analysis in quanteda,r nlp sentimentanalysis quanteda,not yet directly but anew differs from other dictionaries since it does not use a key value pair format but rather assigns a numerical score to each term this means you are not counting matches of values against a key but rather selecting features and then scoring them using weighted counts this could be done in quanteda by get anew features into a character vector use dfmyourtext select anewfeatures to create a dfm with just the anew features multiple each counted value by the valence of each anew value recycled columnwise so that each feature count gets multiplied by its anew value use rowsums on the weighted matrix to get documentlevel valence scores or alternatively file an issue and we will add this functionality to quanteda note also that tidytext uses anew for its sentiment scoring if you want to convert your dfm into their object and use that approach which is basically a version of what ive suggested above updated it turns out i already built the feature into quanteda that you need and had simply not realised it this will work first load in the anew dictionary you have to supply the anew file yourself now that we have a named vector of weights we can apply that using dfmweight below ive first normalised the dfm by relative frequency so that the document aggregate score is not dependent on the document length in tokens if you dont want that just remove the line indicated below

42698919,classify words with the same meaning,pythonx machinelearning nlp nltk textprocessing,the easiest way to accomplish this would be to compare the similarity of the respective word embeddings the most common implementation of this is wordvec wordvec is a way of representing the semantic meaning of a token in a vector space which enables the meanings of words to be compared without requiring a large dictionarythesaurus like wordnet one problem with regular implementations of wordvec is that it does differentiate between different senses of the same word for example the word bank would have the same wordvec representation in all of these sentences the river bank was dry the bank loaned money to me the plane may bank to the left bank has the same vector in each of these cases but you may want them to be sorted into different groups one way to solve this is to use a sensevec implementation sensevec models take into account the context and part of speech and potentially other features of the token allowing you to differentiate between the meanings of different senses of the word a great library for this in python is spacy it is like nltk but much faster as it is written in cython x faster for tokenization and x faster for tagging it also has sensevec embeddings inbuilt so you can accomplish your similarity task without needing other libraries its as simple as its free and has a liberal license

34442266,improving prediction in sklearn,nlp scikitlearn prediction,the performance of your system can depend on a variety of different factors but the features you use and the number of classes targets youre trying to predict play a fundamental role some questions you should ask yourself are how many classes do you have learning to differentiate among different classes is easier than learning if the number of classes increases you probably need more examples is the class distribution balanced in general the best thing would be to have an equal amount of examples for each class sad happy etc with no class being over or underrepresented despite this i believe your problem is in the features the ones you listed in the answer do not seem to be very useful for sentiment analysis the starting pos of a sentence is not indicative as to which feeling is expressed in the sentence nor is i would say the number of wh words or the number of punctuation i cant really give you a specific answer but i suggest you read something about useful features for sentiment analysis the field is vast and there are several approaches you can take a simple search of google scholar will find you lots of material to take inspiration from as an example you could start by taking a look at sentiwordnet which is a sentiment annotated version of wordnet and try to use information contained in it as features for your model edit the only features that i think could be useful for sentiment prediction are the of positive and negative words but i may be mistaken since im not an expert in the field the others like starting pos ending pos number of wh words may be useful for the interrogative vs declarative prediction if youre doing nothing wrong in your code and your results are not good then you have to experiment with moredifferent features also dont use all the features for each task you should design a specific feature set for each thing you are trying to predict as feature that are useful for sentiment analysis may not be useful for other predictions and viceversa and they could be actually confusing for the classifier there are lots of methods to see if a feature has predictive value for a target for example see this but i never used them so i cant give a practical feedback on that maybe you should look if there is something already implemented in sklearn that you can use

32913155,missing values in sentiment classification,python machinelearning nlp sentimentanalysis,restating the problem is that the five binary models youve trained are not mutually exhaustive there are several possibilities first of all do you have a clean classification for each of the five sentiments or are there some acknowledged classification errors you need a set that is mutually exclusive and exhaustive your approach suggests but hardly guarantees this result you might consider an integrated solution that does make this guarantee multiclass svm is one such but may not apply well to your situation if the classes are not accurate you can easily have all five rejecting a particular observation this suggests that your classification algorithms need tuning or that the data themselves are not as amenable to classification as you would like you might also check that youve cleaned that data appropriately a few errors can seriously move the class boundaries what i suspect is happening is a smallboundary effect each class when compared against the combination of the other four pulls in its boundaries leaving unclaimed territory between the final sets do you have a way to check the classification parameters after training if so can you visualize the five boundaries selected if you do find pathological gaps are there training parameters you can tune such as giving a larger epsilon to the training groups i hope this helps
32752216,spark word classification,machinelearning apachespark nlp,firstly we should be clear that the correct approach will depend on the data this task is called language detection or language identification even for entire sentences or pages vectors from entire words is not the right approach it would only work on names you have actually encountered in training like a list no real prediction rather you need an ngram model based on characters for example in bigram model gimli g gi im ml li i unfortunately you cannot use pysparkmlfeaturengram for this out of the box because it assumes a gram is a word not a character what to do you must first find or write a function to do this transform to character ngrams and apply it to both the original names and to queries that come into your system if names have spaces treat those as a character too then in spark terminology these character ngrams are your words and the string containing all eg g gi im ml li i of them is your document and if you like you can now use ngram splitting words into g i m l i and then using ngram with n should be equivalent to splitting into g gi im once you frame it in that way it will be a flavour of the standard document classification problem actually regression in strict spark terminology for which spark has a few options the main thing to note is that order is important do not use approaches that treat it like a bag of words so although all of the spark classification examples to be found vectorise with tfidf and it will not completely fail in your case it will be suboptimal because i assume that actually ordercontext of each character ngram is important as far as optimising it for accuracy there are possible refinements around alphabets special chars case sensitivity stemming etc it depends on your data see below it would be interesting if you posted a link to the entire dataset regarding the data and assumptions about it the character ngram approach works well for identifying actual human languages from planet earth even for human languages there are special cases for classes of text like names for example chinese characters could be used or languages like haitian or tagolog where many of the names are just french or spanish or persian or urdu where they are just arabic pronounced differently but spellt the same we know the basic problems and techniques for words from major human languages but for all we know the names in your data are in random or mixed alphabets contain special characters like or normally more likely seen in urls are numbers likewise interesting is the question of how they correlate to group membership for example it could be that the named are randomly generated from alphabetic chars or simply a list of english names or generated using any other other approach and then randomly assigned to class a or b in this case it is not possible predict whether names yet unseen are members of a or b it is also possible that as are named for the day of the week on which they were born but bs for the day of the week on which they were conceived in this case it is possible but not without more information in other scenario again the same generator is used but names are assigned to a or b based on length ie number some cutoff of charsbytesvowelsuppercase length ie number even or odd of in these cases a completely different set of features must be extracted in yet another scenario names of b are always repeated blocks like johnjohn in this case character ngram frequencies can work better than random guessing but is not the optimal approach so you will always need some intuition about the problem its difficult for us to make assumptions about an artificial world from the examples you have given we might assume the names are somewhat englishish and finally you must try different approaches and features and ideally whatever classifier you choose simply ignores useless signals at least in the real world features like word count char count and byte count are actually useful for this problem they can augment the character ngram approach

31077378,nlp with python how to build a corpus which classifier to use,python nlp scikitlearn,question the most straightforward way to think of this is as a text classification task sentiment analysis is one kind of text classification task but by no means the only one alternatively as you point out you could consider your data as existing on a continuum ranging from cancel strongest action previously taken to take strongest action with take no action in the middle in this case you could treat the outcome as a continuous variable with a natural ordering if so then you could treat this as a regression problem rather than a classification problem its hard to know whether this is a sensible thing to do without knowing more about the data if you suspect you will have a number of wordsphrases that will be very probable at one end of the scale and very improbable at the other or vice versa then regression may make sense on the other hand if the relevant wordsphrases are associated with strong emotion and are likely to appear at either end of the scale but not in the middle then you may be better off treating it as classification it also depends on how you want to evaluate your results if your algorithm predicts that a document is a and its actually a will it be penalized less than if it had predicted if so it might be better to treat this as a regression task question am i correct in assuming that these are my two general options for building the corpus am i missing some other better option note that the set of documents the txt files of meeting minutes and corresponding outcomes is your corpus the typical thing to do is randomly select or so to be set aside as test data and use the remaining as training data the two general options you consider above are options for selecting the set of features that your classification or regression algorithm should attend to you correctly identify the upsides and downsides of the two most obvious approaches for coming up with features handpicking your own vs pang lees approach of just using unigrams words as phrases personally id also lean towards this latter approach given that its notoriously hard for humans to predict which phrases will be useful for classificationalthough theres no reason why you couldnt combine the two having your initial set of features include all words plus whatever phrases you think might be particularly relevant as you point out there will be a lot of extraneous words so it may help to throw out words that are very infrequent or that dont differ enough in frequency between classes to provide any discriminative power approaches for reducing an initial set of features are known as feature selection techniques one common method is mentioned here or see this paper for a more comprehensive list you could also consider features like the percent of highvalence words higharousal words or highdominance words using the dataset here click supplementary material and download the zip depending on how much effort you want to put into this project another common thing to do is to try a whole bunch of approaches and see which works best of course you cant test which approach works best using data in the test setthat would be cheating and would run the risk of overfitting to the test data but you can set aside a small part of your training set as validation data ie a minitest set that you use for testing different approaches given that you dont have that much training data documents or so you could consider using cross validation question the best way is probably to try different approaches and pick whatever works best in crossvalidation but if i had to pick one or two i personally have found that knearest neighbor classification with low k or svms often work well for this kind of thing a reasonable approach might be having your initial features be all unigrams words phrases that you think might be predictive after you look at some training data applying a feature selection technique to trim down your feature set applying any algorithm that can deal with highdimensionaltext features such as those in lots of good tips in that pdf or those that achieved decent performance in the pang lee paper other possibilities are discussed in often the specific algorithm matters less than the features that go into it frankly it sounds like a very difficult sort of classification task so its possible that nothing will work very well if you decide to treat it as a regression rather than a classification task you could go with k nearest neighbors regression or ridge regression random forests often do not work well with large numbers of dependent features words though they may work well if you end up deciding to go with a smaller number of features for example a set of wordsphrases you manually select plus of highvalence words and of higharousal words

27354596,how to use labels to classify text with scikitlearn,python python machinelearning nlp artificialintelligence,in the above code assuming that we have a feature vector named doc if you write result should be either or so the prediction result is numeric thus its better to assign the labels accordingly however if you still want to assign a string label then you can assume that for example label a is equivalent to and b to i know that unlike scikit in nltk the labels are string by default but is there any difference edit i can see from your first edit that you might have a misconception about feature vectors and their labels first of all the type of label you assign doesnt affect the outcome meaning that if you assign a class label as spam and one as nonspam the classifier doesnt automagically detect spams and nonspams the classification depends on your feature vector and then for comparison sake a class label so if you say i would assume that in my code represents a spam and represents a ham and you would label your data accordingly it works and its enough second issue is that im not sure if you know how a bigram feature vector should look like because of the way you represented your data by writing the bellow code a bigram feature vector should contain all possible features present in your data set and then for representing each document you have to assign a to all the feature present in that document and a to the rest as an example i will rewrite your above example in the correct form now we can write the feature vectors of the above documens in the following form notice that the label for the first document is or spam and for the second document its or ham i tried to make a very clear example when using scikit you might prefer using numpy arrays instead of list but my example is clear reading this question here about bigrams along with my answer might help you let me know if you had further questions but try to think about the above example edit just in case you are wondering how to write the labels in the variable labels in your code for each document which is converted to a feature vector representation you have to have a corresponding label in your code array x contains the feature vectors so in labels you have to have labels with the same position in array as x corresponding to each feature vector thus assuming that you have documents spam or and ham or your labels should look like this but this depends on how you have ordered your data some classifiers would take the labels like above and some would take s and s interlayed such as in svmsvc you can use the later however make sure that your feature vectors are also interlayed and correspond to the right labels

19781644,sentiment analysis using perceptron,machinelearning nlp neuralnetwork sentimentanalysis perceptron,perceptron is just a simple binary classifier that works on fixed size vectors from rn as input data so in order to use it you have to encode each of your documents in such a realvalued vector it could be for example a bagofwords representation where each dimension corresponds to one wor and the value to number of occurences or any more complex representation one of which is described in the attached paper so in order to port perceptron to sentiment analysis you have to figure out some function f that feeded with document returns realvalued vector and then train you perceptron on pairs fx for negative reviews fx for positive reviews
18754589,what is the difference between evaluation metrics and features in relation to binary classification,machinelearning nlp,it seems that you are completely missing the meaning of basic concepts here evaluation metric is a function which given some modelalgorithm answers and some golden standard true answers provided by an expert measures how good is your modelalgorithm it has nothing ok not nothing as it is often used during crossvalidation and tuning models parameters to do with the actual classification process it is not used to make any decisions it is a method of quantifing how good are your results features are just data representation so there are related in the sense that they are part of the problem and obiously correct choice of features also called feature engineering has a big impact on the quality of your model but a possible feature of the data which then could be used to classify inputs into having this feature or not is rather meaningless feature is a value of some function often called feature detector lets call it f which applied to your input object x returns some value for example number or a there is notthere is representation of some phenomen for example such feature could be for text documents does given text contain substring in the past and so fi like trainsfalse and fi liked trains in the past true you do not train classifier to detect features you extract them using some simple efficient algorithm to represent your data which is then used to classify them to some classes once you have f there would be no point in classify inputs into having this feature because f does exactly this of course it is possible to actually train classifiers for filling in missing features when they are not avaliable for some data points but this is a more advanced topic and it does not seem to be the part of your question i would recommend you to watch some great introduction videos into machine learning by andrew ng avaliable on the coursera platform
18391035,is it possible to supplement naive bayes text classification algorithm with author information,text machinelearning nlp classification bayesian,there is no need to modify anything simply add this information to your naive bayes and it will work just fine and as it was previously mentioned in the comment do not change any priors prior probability is pclass this has nothing to do with actual features just add to your computations another feature corresponding to the authorship eg authorauthor and train naive bayes as usual ie compute pclassauthorauthor for each class and author and use it later on in your classification processif your current representation is a bag of words it is sufficient to add a artificial word of form authorauthor to it one other option would be to train independent classifier for each author which would capture personspecific type of speech for example one uses lots of words environment only when talking about nature while other simply likes to add this word in each speach oh in our local environment of independent nbs would capture these kind of phenomena

15777201,why vector normalization can improve the accuracy of clustering and classification,machinelearning nlp classification mahout,normalization is not always required but it rarely hurts some examples kmeans kmeans clustering is isotropic in all directions of space and therefore tends to produce more or less round rather than elongated clusters in this situation leaving variances unequal is equivalent to putting more weight on variables with smaller variance example in matlab fyi how can i detect if my dataset is clustered or unclustered ie forming one single cluster distributed clustering the comparative analysis shows that the distributed clustering results depend on the type of normalization procedure artificial neural network inputs if the input variables are combined linearly as in an mlp then it is rarely strictly necessary to standardize the inputs at least in theory the reason is that any rescaling of an input vector can be effectively undone by changing the corresponding weights and biases leaving you with the exact same outputs as you had before however there are a variety of practical reasons why standardizing the inputs can make training faster and reduce the chances of getting stuck in local optima also weight decay and bayesian estimation can be done more conveniently with standardized inputs artificial neural network inputsoutputs should you do any of these things to your data the answer is it depends standardizing either input or target variables tends to make the training process better behaved by improving the numerical condition see ftpftpsascompubneuralillcondillcondhtml of the optimization problem and ensuring that various default values involved in initialization and termination are appropriate standardizing targets can also affect the objective function standardization of cases should be approached with caution because it discards information if that information is irrelevant then standardizing cases can be quite helpful if that information is important then standardizing cases can be disastrous interestingly changing the measurement units may even lead one to see a very different clustering structure kaufman leonard and peter j rousseeuw finding groups in data an introduction to cluster analysis in some applications changing the measurement units may even lead one to see a very different clustering structure for example the age in years and height in centimeters of four imaginary people are given in table and plotted in figure it appears that a b and c are two wellseparated clusters on the other hand when height is expressed in feet one obtains table and figure where the obvious clusters are now a c and b d this partition is completely different from the first because each subject has received another companion figure would have been flattened even more if age had been measured in days to avoid this dependence on the choice of measurement units one has the option of standardizing the data this converts the original measurements to unitless variables kaufman et al continues with some interesting considerations page from a philosophical point of view standardization does not really solve the problem indeed the choice of measurement units gives rise to relative weights of the variables expressing a variable in smaller units will lead to a larger range for that variable which will then have a large effect on the resulting structure on the other hand by standardizing one attempts to give all variables an equal weight in the hope of achieving objectivity as such it may be used by a practitioner who possesses no prior knowledge however it may well be that some variables are intrinsically more important than others in a particular application and then the assignment of weights should be based on subjectmatter knowledge see eg abrahamowicz on the other hand there have been attempts to devise clustering techniques that are independent of the scale of the variables friedman and rubin the proposal of hardy and rasson is to search for a partition that minimizes the total volume of the convex hulls of the clusters in principle such a method is invariant with respect to linear transformations of the data but unfortunately no algorithm exists for its implementation except for an approximation that is restricted to two dimensions therefore the dilemma of standardization appears unavoidable at present and the programs described in this book leave the choice up to the user

15326694,sentiment analysis on large collection of online conversation text,python nlp nltk textmining sentimentanalysis,training any classifier requires a training set of labeled data and a feature extractor to obtain feature sets for each text after you have a trained classifier you can apply it to previously unseen text unlabeled and obtain a classification based on the machine learning algorithm used nltk gives a good explanation and some samples to play around with if you are interested in building a classifier for positivenegative sentiment using your own training dataset i would avoid simple keyword counts as they arent accurate for a number of reasons eg negation of positive words not happy an alternative where you can still use a large training set without having to manually label anything is distant supervision basically this approach uses emoticons or other specific text elements as noisy labels you still have to choose which features are relevant but many studies have had good results with simply using unigrams or bigrams individual words or pairs of words respectively all of this can be done relatively easily with python and nltk you can also choose to use a tool like nltktrainer which is a wrapper for nltk and requires less code i think this study by go et al is one of the easiest to understand you can also read other studies for distant supervision distant supervision sentiment analysis and sentiment analysis there are a few builtin classifiers in nltk with both training and classification methods naive bayes maxent etc but if you are interested in using support vector machines svm then you should look elsewhere technically nltk provides you with an svm class but its really just a wrapper for pysvmlight which itself is a wrapper for svmlight written in c i had numerous problems with this approach though and would instead recommend libsvm for determining the topic many have used simple keywords but there are some more complex methods available

14574462,news article categorization subject entity analysis via nlp preferably in nodejs,nodejs nlp,i dont know if you are still looking for an answer but let me put my two cents for anyone who happens to come back to this question having worked in nlp i would suggest you look into the following approach to solve the problem dont look for a single package solution there are great packages out there no doubt for lots of things but when it comes to active research areas like nlp ml and optimization the tools tend to be atleast or iterations behind whats there is academia coming to the core problem what you want to achieve is text classification the simplest way to achieve this would be an svm multiclass classifier simplest yes but also with very very see the double stress reasonable classification accuracy runtime performance and ease of use the thing which you would need to work on would be the feature set used to represent your news articletexttag you could use a bag of words model add named entities as additional features you can use article locationtime as features though for a simple category classification this might not give you much improvement the bottom line is svm works great they have multiple implementations and during runtime you dont really need much ml machinery feature engineering on the other hand is very task specific but given some basic set of features and a good labelled data you can train a very decent classifier here are some resources for you svm multiclass is what you would be interested in and here is a tutorial by svm zen himself i dont know about the stability of this but from the code its a binary classifier svm which means if you have a known set of tags of size n you want to classify the text into you will have to train n binary svm classifiers one each for the n category tags hope this helps

13603882,feature selection and reduction for text classification,python nlp svm sentimentanalysis featureextraction,this is probably a bit late to the table but as bee points out and you are already aware the use of svm as a classifier is wasted if you have already lost the information in the stages prior to classification however the process of text classification requires much more that just a couple of stages and each stage has significant effects on the result therefore before looking into more complicated feature selection measures there are a number of much simpler possibilities that will typically require much lower resource consumption do you preprocess the documents before performing tokensiationrepresentation into the bagofwords format simply removing stop words or punctuation may improve accuracy considerably have you considered altering your bagofwords representation to use for example word pairs or ngrams instead you may find that you have more dimensions to begin with but that they condense down a lot further and contain more useful information its also worth noting that dimension reduction is feature selectionfeature extraction the difference is that feature selection reduces the dimensions in a univariate manner ie it removes terms on an individual basis as they currently appear without altering them whereas feature extraction which i think ben allison is referring to is multivaritate combining one or more single terms together to produce higher orthangonal terms that hopefully contain more information and reduce the feature space regarding your use of document frequency are you merely using the probabilitypercentage of documents that contain a term or are you using the term densities found within the documents if category one has only douments and they each contain a term once then category one is indeed associated with the document however if category two has only documents that each contain the same term a hundred times each then obviously category two has a much higher relation to that term than category one if term densities are not taken into account this information is lost and the fewer categories you have the more impact this loss with have on a similar note it is not always prudent to only retain terms that have high frequencies as they may not actually be providing any useful information for example if a term appears a hundred times in every document then it is considered a noise term and while it looks important there is no practical value in keeping it in your feature set also how do you index the data are you using the vector space model with simple boolean indexing or a more complicated measure such as tfidf considering the low number of categories in your scenario a more complex measure will be beneficial as they can account for term importance for each category in relation to its importance throughout the entire dataset personally i would experiment with some of the above possibilities first and then consider tweaking the feature selectionextraction with a or a combination of complex equations if you need an additional performance boost additional based on the new information it sounds as though you are on the right track and accuracy f or bep precision and recall based for multiclass problems is generally considered very good for most datasets it might be that you have successfully acquired all information rich features from the data already or that a few are still being pruned having said that something that can be used as a predictor of how good aggressive dimension reduction may be for a particular dataset is outlier count analysis which uses the decline of information gain in outlying features to determine how likely it is that information will be lost during feature selection you can use it on the raw andor processed data to give an estimate of how aggressively you should aim to prune features or unprune them as the case may be a paper describing it can be found here paper with outlier count information with regards to describing tfidf as an indexing method you are correct in it being a feature weighting measure but i consider it to be used mostly as part of the indexing process though it can also be used for dimension reduction the reasoning for this is that some measures are better aimed toward feature selectionextraction while others are preferable for feature weighting specifically in your document vectors ie the indexed data this is generally due to dimension reduction measures being determined on a per category basis whereas index weighting measures tend to be more document orientated to give superior vector representation in respect to lda lsi and movmf im afraid i have too little experience of them to provide any guidance unfortunately ive also not worked with turkish datasets or the python language
13555021,supervised latent dirichlet allocation for document classification,machinelearning nlp classification documentclassification lda,for what its worth lda as a classifier is going to be fairly weak because its a generative model and classification is a discriminative problem there is a variant of lda called supervised lda which uses a more discriminative criterion to form the topics you can get source for this in various places and theres also a paper with a max margin formulation that i dont know the status of sourcecodewise i would avoid the labelled lda formulation unless youre sure thats what you want because it makes a strong assumption about the correspondence between topics and categories in the classification problem however its worth pointing out that none of these methods use the topic model directly to do the classification instead they take documents and instead of using wordbased features use the posterior over the topics the vector that results from inference for the document as its feature representation before feeding it to a classifier usually a linear svm this gets you a topic model based dimensionality reduction followed by a strong discriminative classifier which is probably what youre after this pipeline is available in most languages using popular toolkits
13329159,product categorization,machinelearning nlp product categorization,machine learning ml typically relies on training data which allows the ml logic to produce and validate a model of the underlying data with this model it is then in a position to infer the class of new data presented to it in the classifier application as the one at hand or to infer the value of some variable in the regression case as would be say an ml application predicting the amount of rain a particular region will receive next month the situation presented in the question is a bit puzzling at several levels firstly the number of automobile manufacturers is finite and relatively small it would therefore be easy to manually make the list of these manufacturers and then simply use this lexicon to parse out the manufacturers from the model numbers using plain string parsing techniques ie no ml needed or even desired here alas the requirement that one would be using only those files seems to preclude this option secondly one can think of a few patterns or heuristics that could be used to produce the desired classifier tentatively a relatively weak one as the patternsheuristics that come to mind atm seem relatively unreliable furthermore such an approach is also not quite an ml approach in the common understanding of the word

12065503,predicting next char in random text generation based on some input file,c nlp,if you really want a characterbased model you wont get very natural looking text as output but it is definitely possible and that model will fundamentally be able to deal with sequences of space characters as well there is no need to remove them from the input if you consider them a natural part of the text what is important is that a markov model does not always fall back to predicting the one character that has the highest probability at any given stage instead it must look at the entire probability distribution of possible characters and chooses one randomly here randomly means it picks a character not predetermined by the programmer still the random distribution is not the uniform distribution ie not all characters are equally likely it has to take into account the relative probabilities of the various possible characters one way to do this is to generate a cumulative probability distribution of characters ie for example if the probabilities are we represent them as then to generate a random character we first generate a uniformly distributed random number n between and and then choose the first character whose cumulative probability is no less than n i have implemented this in the example code below the train procedure generates a cumulative probability distribution of the followingcharacters for every character in the training input the predict procedure applies this to generate random text for a full implementation this still lacks a representation of the probability distribution for the initial character as you see in the main function my output simply always starts with t a representation of the length of the output string or the final character main simply always generates a string of length the code was tested with gcc c option on linux example output below some example output generated by this program as you can see the distribution of space characters follows sort of naturally the distribution found in the input text

1695841,how to make words into a category nlp,python text nlp nltk,that problem is difficult to solve procedurally but much progress has been made in the area lately most natural language processing begins with a grammar which may or may not be context free its a set of construction rules stating how more general things are made out of more specific ones example context free grammar this is obviously oversimplified but the task of making a complete grammar to define all of english is enormous and most real systems only define some subset of it applicable to a problem domain once a grammar has been defined or learned using complicated algorithms known only to the likes of google a string called an exemplar is parsed according to the grammar which tags each word with the parts of speech a grammar that is very complex would not just have the parts of speech you learned in school but categories such as websites names of old people and ingredients these categories can be laboriously built into the grammar by humans or inferred using things like analogical modeling or support vector machines in each things like chicken football bbq and cricket would be defined as points in a very high dimensional space along with millions of other points and then the clustering algorithms would define groups just based on the positions of those points relative to eachother then one might try to infer names for the groups from example text link text this google search lists several techniques used in nlp and you could learn a whole lot from them edit to just solve this problem one might crawl the web for sentences of the form is a to build up a database of itemcategory relationships then you parse a string like above and look for words that are known items in the database
1490061,classifying text based on groups of keywords,algorithm nlp textprocessing,you might want to look the category of similarity measures or distance measures which is different in data mining lingo than classification basically a similarity measure is a way in math you can take two sets of data in your case words do some computationequationalgorithm the result being that you have some number which tells you how similar that data is with similarity measures this number is a number between and where means nothing matches at all and means identical so you can actually think of your sentence as a vector and each word in your sentence represents an element of that vector likewise for each categorys list of keywords and then you can do something very simple take the cosine similarity or jaccard index depending on how you structure your data what both of these metrics do is they take both vectors your input sentence and your keyword list and give you a number if you do this across all of your categories you can rank those numbers in order to see which match has the greatest similarity coefficient as an example from your question customer transactions deposits deposit customer account accounts so you could construct a vector with elements this means that for the customer transactions keyword you have words and this will sound obvious but each of those words is present in your search string keep with me so now you take your sentence the system shall apply deposits to a customers specified account this has words from the customer transactions set deposits account customer actually this illustrates another nuance you actually have customers is this equivalent to customer the vector for your sentence might be the s in this vector are in the same position as the s in the first vector because those words are the same so we could say how many times do these vectors differ lets compare hm they have the same bit times in the st rd and th position they only differ by bits so lets say that when we compare these two vectors we have a distance of congrats we just computed the hamming distance the lower your hamming distance the more similar the data the difference between a similarity measure and a distance measure is that the former is normalized it gives you a value between and a distance is just any number so it only gives you a relative value anyway this might not be the best way to do natural language processing but for your purposes it is the simplest and might actually work pretty well for your application or at least as a starting point ps classification as you have in your title would be answering the question if you take my sentence which category is it most likely to fall into which is a bit different than saying how much more similar is my sentence to category than category which seems to be what youre after good luck

62270525,in pytorch whats the difference between training an rnn to predict the last word given a sequence vs predicting the entire sequence shifted,python machinelearning pytorch recurrentneuralnetwork languagemodel,consider the sequence prediction problem a b c d where you want to train an rnn via teacher forcing if you only use the last word in the sentence you are doing the following classification problem on the left is the input on the right is the output youre supposed to predict a b c d for your second approach where y is set to be the entire sequence shifted right you are doing three classification problems the task of predicting the intermediate words in a sequence is crucial for training a useful rnn otherwise you would know how to get from c given a b but you wouldnt know how to proceed after just a an equivalent thing to do would be to do define your training data as both the complete sequence a b c d and all incomplete sequences a b a b c then if you were to do just the last word prediction as mentioned previously you would end up with the same supervision as the formulation where y is the entire sequence shifted right but this is computationally wasteful you dont want to rerun the rnn on both a b and a b c the state you get from a b can be reused to obtain the state after consuming a b c in other words the point of doing the shift y right is to split a single sequence a b c d of length n into n independent classification problems of the form given words up to time t predict word t while needing just one rnn forward pass
62069350,transformerxl input and labels for language modeling,huggingfacetransformers languagemodel,that does sound like a typo from another models convention you do have to pass data twice once to inputids and once to labels in your case for both the model will then attempt to predict from i am not sure adding something at the beginning of the target tensor would work as that would probably cause size mismatches later down the line passing twice is the default way to do this in transformers before the aforementioned pr transfoxl did not shift labels internally and you had to shift the labels yourself the pr changed it to be consistent with the library and the documentation where you have to pass the same data twice

69533961,how to configure and train the model using glove and cnn for text classification,python tensorflow convneuralnetwork stanfordnlp textclassification,two things that come to my mind your maxpooling layers are reducing the size of the input to the next convolutional layers every time and eventually the size is too small to run another maxpooling operation try running after each maxpooling operation and you will quickly find out that your tensor cannot be further reduced you can then consider using a different poolsize in your maxpooling layers the second thing i notice i am not sure if it is intentional but maxpoolingd global max pooling keras supports both operations take a look at the documentation on a side note sentence classification with cnns was widely popularized by the work of yoon kim in his work he shows that global maxpooling operations perform much better than striding maxpooling operations in sentence classification when using word embeddings as you are doing

65018504,keyword extraction and keyword based text classification,deeplearning keyword featureextraction textclassification keywordextraction,keyword extraction is typically done using tfidf scores simply by setting a score threshold when training a classifier it does not make much sense to cut off the keywords at a certain threshold knowing that something is not likely to be a keyword might also be a valuable piece of information for the classifier the simplest way to get the tfidf scores for particular words is using tfidfvectorizer in scikitlearn that does all the laborious text preprocessing steps tokenization removing stop words you can probably achieve better results by finetuning bert for your classification task but of course at the expense of much higher computational costs
64728393,ternary classification of the type a b or any,machinelearning neuralnetwork classification textclassification,i think that you are in the situation of multilabel classification and not multiclass classifcation as stated here in machine learning multilabel classification and the strongly related problem of multioutput classification are variants of the classification problem where multiple labels may be assigned to each instance which means that instances can have more than class associated to them usually when you work with a binary classification eg classes you can have as final layer of your network one neuron which will output continues values between and using as activation function the sigmoid one and as loss the binary crossentropy given your situation you could decide to use two neurons as output of your neural network for each one you can use the sigmoid activation function and as loss the binarycross entropy in this way each instance can be associated with both classes with a specific probability by the model this means that for each instance you should associate two classes or rather labels for example for your verbs you should have past present classes and your model will try to output two probabilities with the architecture explained before basically you have two independent probabilites if you check the sum of one row is not and therefore you can associate to one instance both classes instead if you wanted a mutually exclusive classification with more than classes you should have used the categorical crossentropy as loss and the softmax activation function in your last layer the which will basically handle the outputs to generate a vector of probabilities that sums to example check here to see an extensive example
64533169,suppressing false positives incorrectly classified as outlieranomaly in anomaly detection using autoencoders,python machinelearning textclassification autoencoder anomalydetection,since the anomaly detector is usually trained unsupervised it can be hard to incorporate labels directly into that process without loosing outlier detection properties a simple alternative is to take the instances that were marked as anomalies and put them into a classifier that classifies into real anomaly vs not real anomaly this classifier would be trained on prior anomalies that have been labeled it can be either binary classification or oneclass wrt to known not real samples a simple starting point would be knearestneighbours or a domainspecific distance function the classifier can use the latent feature vector as input or do its own feature extraction this kind of system is described in anomaly detection with false positive suppression relayrio the same basic idea is used in this paper to minimize false negative rate sniper fewshot learning for anomaly detection to minimize falsenegative rate with ensured truepositive rate

62848208,classification tweet sentiment analysis order of steps,python machinelearning classification sentimentanalysis textclassification,there are lots of ways to do this and people have strong opinions about it and im not always convinced they fully understand what they advocate tldr your methodology looks great and youre asking sensible questions having said that here are some things to consider why are you doing traintest split validation why are you doing hyperparameter tuning why are you doing crossvalidation yes each of these techniques are good at doing something specific but that doesnt necessarily mean they should all be part of the same pipeline first off lets answer these questions traintest split is useful for testing your classifiers inference abilities in other words we want to know how well a classifier performs in general not on the data we used for training the test portion allows us to evaluate our classifier without using our training portion hyperparametertuning is useful for evaluating the effect of hyperparameters on the performance of a classifier for it to be meaningful we must compare two or more models using different hyperparameters but trained preferably using the same training portion to eliminate selection bias what do we do once we know the best performing hyperparameters will this set of hyperparameters always perform optimally no you will see that due to the stochastic nature of classification one hyperparameter set may work best in experiment a then another set of hyperparameters may work best on experiment b rather hyperparameter tuning is good for generalizing about which hyperparameters to use when building a classifier crossvalidation is used to smooth out some of the stochastic randomness associated with building classifiers so a machine learning pipeline may produce a classifier that is accurate using testfold and accuracy using another testfold what does it mean it might mean that fold contains samples that are easy or it might mean that the classifier for whatever reason is actually better you dont know because its a black box practically how is this helpful i see little value in using testtrain split and crossvalidation i use crossvalidation and report accuracy as an average over the nfolds it is already testing my classifiers performance i dont see why dividing your training data further to do another round of traintest validation is going to help use the average having said that i use the best performing model of the nfold models created during crossvalidation as my final model as i said its blackbox so we cant know which model is best but all else being equal you may as well use the best performing one it might actually be better hyperparametertuning is useful but it can take forever to do extensive tuning i suggest adding hyperparameter tuning to your pipeline but only test sets of hyperparameters so keep all your hyperparameters constant except eg batch size run that and youll be able to say with confidence oh that made a big difference works better than or well that was a waste of time it didnt make much difference either way if the difference is small ignore that hyperparameter and try another pair this way youll slowly tack towards optimal without all the wasted time in practice id say leave the extensive hyperparametertuning to academics and take a more pragmatic approach but yeah youre methodology looks good as it is i think you thinking about what youre doing and that already puts you a step ahead of the pack

58899755,how to build keras classification model using two text features as input,keras textclassification,so the simplest form i can come up for this question is the following hope it is pretty straightforward what is happening here you have two submodels created one produces descout and the other produces taxout then using those two outputs you create the final model output finalout and you use that along with the input layers to create a model object i think using sequential is unnecessary here and you dont need to explicitly have models for the two submodels as youre not doing optimization particular to submodels rather you optimizer the full thing at once
58869955,is it possible to train the sentiment classification model with the labeled data and then use it to predict sentiment on data that is not labeled,nltk python sentimentanalysis textclassification trainingdata,is it possible to train the sentiment classification model with the labeled data and then use it to predict sentiment on data that is not labeled yes this is basically the definition of what supervised learning is ie you train on data that has labels so that you can then put it into production on categorizing your data that does not have labels any book on supervised learning will have code examples i wonder if your question might really be can i use supervised learning to make a model assign labels to another articles then do further machine learning on all articles well the answer is still yes but the quality will fall somewhere between these two extremes assign random labels to the bad results get a domain expert assign correct labels to those good results your model could fall anywhere between those two extremes it is useful to know where it is so know if it is worth using the data you can get an estimate of that by taking a sample say records and have them also assigned by a domain expert if all match there is a reasonable chance your other records also have been given good labels if eg only of the match the model is much closer to the random end of the spectrum and using the other records is probably a bad idea etc are arbitrary examples choose based on the number of different labels and your desired confidence in the results
58221470,is this classification model overfitting,machinelearning scikitlearn classification textclassification overfittingunderfitting,firstly in your graph there are different models its hard to tell if one of them is overfitting because overfitting can be detected with a epoch vs performance train valid graph there would be in your case overfitting means that after a certain number of epochs as the number of epoch increases training accuracy goes up while validation accuracy goes down this can be the case for example when you have too few data points regarding the complexity of your problem hence your model is using spurious correlations with your graph what we can say is that the complexity of your problem seems to require a high number or training instances because your validation performance keep increasing as you add more training instances there is a chance that the model with could be overiftting too and we dont see that because you are using early stopping

56243043,how can i classify big text data with scikitlearn,python machinelearning scikitlearn textclassification,you can utilize warmstarttrue and call partialfit instead of fit see the documentation here for the model you are using where it describes that argument and function respectively basically you would load only a portion of the data at a time run it through your pipeline and call partialfit in a loop this would keep the memory requirements down while also allowing you to train on all the data regardless of the amount edit as noted in the comments the above mentioned loop will only work for the predictive model so the data preprocessing will need to occur separately here is a solution for training the countvectorizer iteratively this question contains a tfidf implementation that doesnt require all of the data to be loaded into memory so the final solution would be to preprocess the data in two stages the first for the countvectorizer and the second for the tfidf weighting then to train the model you follow the same process as originally proposed except without a pipeline because that is no longer needed

56060044,text classification issue,tensorflow machinelearning keras textclassification,your loss curves makes sense as we see the network overfit to training set while we see the usual bowlshaped validation curve to make your network perform better you can always deepen it more layers widen it more units per hidden layer andor add more nonlinear activation functions for your layers to be able to map to a wider range of values also i believe the reason why you originally got so many repeated values is due to the size of your network apparently each of the data points has roughly features pretty large feature space the size of your network is too small and the possible space of output values that can be mapped to is consequently smaller i did some testing with some larger hidden unit layers and bumped up the number of layers and was able to see that the prediction values did vary it is also understandable that your network performance varies so because the number of features that you have is about times the size of your training usually you would like a smaller proportion keep in mind that training for too many epochs like more than for so small training and test dataset to see improvements in loss is not great practice as you can seriously overfit and is probably a sign that your network needs to be widerdeeper all of these factors such as layer size hidden unit size and even number of epochs can be treated as hyperparameters in other words hold out some percentage of your training data as part of your validation split go one by one through the each category of factors and optimize to get the highest validation accuracy to be fair your training set is not too high but i believe you should hold out some of the training as a sort of validation set to tune these hyperparameters given that you have such a large number of features per data point at the end of this process you should be able to determine your true test accuracy this is how i would optimize to get the best performance of this network hope this helps more about training test val split

55309197,docvec classification very poor results,python classification gensim textclassification docvec,you dont mention the size of your dataset in rows total words unique words or unique classes docvec works best with lots of data most published work trains on tensofthousands to millions of documents of dozens to thousands of words each your data appears to only have words per document also published work tends to train on data where every document has a uniqueid it can sometimes make sense to use knownlabels as tags instead of or in addition to uniqueids but it isnt necessarily a better approach by using knownlabels as the only tags youre effectively only training one docvector per label its essentially similar to concatenating all rows with the same tag into one document youre inexplicably using fewer steps in inference than epochs in training when in fact these are analogous values in recent versions of gensim inference will by default use the same number of inference epochs as the model was configured to use for training and its more common to use more epochs during inference than training also youre inexplicably using different starting alpha values for inference for both classifiertraining and classifiertesting but the main problem is likely your choice of tiny size doc vectors instead of the tfidfvectorizer which will summarize each row as a vector of width equal to the uniqueword count perhaps hundreds or thousands of dimensions your docvec model summarizes each document as just values youve essentially lobotomized docvec usual values here are though if the dataset is tiny smaller sizes may be required finally the lemmatizationstemming may not be strictly necessary and may even be destructive lots of wordvecdocvec work doesnt bother to lemmatizestem often because theres plentiful data with many appearances of all word forms these steps are most likely to help with smaller data by making sure rarer word forms are combined with related longer forms to still get value from words that would otherwise be too rare to be retained or get useful vectors but i can see many ways they might hurt for your domain manager and management wont have exactly the same implications in this context but could both be stemmed to manag similar for security and securities both becoming secur and other words id only perform these steps if you can prove through evaluation that theyre helping are the words passed to the tfidfvectorizer being lemmatizedstemmed
55270053,countvectorizer values work alone in classifier cannot get working when adding other features,python scikitlearn classification textclassification countvectorizer,i would do this the other way around and add your features to your vectorization here is what i mean with a toy example suppose now you have you features in a dataframe called df and your labels in ytrain you want to perform a text vectorization on column c and add the features a and b to your vectorization this will return but countvectest now is a scipy sparse matrix so what you need to do is add your features to this matrix like this this will return as expected then you can train your random forest nb in the code snippet you provided you passed the label info the bot column to the training features which you should obviously not do
55096725,use wordvec word embeding as feature vector for text classification simlar to count vectorizertfidf feature vector,machinelearning scikitlearn wordvec textclassification wordembedding,you first should understand what word embeddings are when you apply a countvectorizer or tfidfvectorizer what you get is a sentence representation in a sparse way commonly known as a one hot encoding the word embeddings representation are used to represent a word in a high dimensional space of real numbers once you get your per word representation there are some ways to do this checkhow to get vector for a sentence from the wordvec of tokens in sentence
55018167,one category text classification on imbalanced dataset,tensorflow machinelearning keras svm textclassification,first of all are you sure there are no positive classes in those you deemed negative rubbish in rubbish out make sure its not the case here what are the ways to tackle such problems in the order i would approach the problem make sure your data representation is good if you are working with text data you should use word vectors like pretrained wordvec also available in tensorflow and tensorflow hub you can find a more advanced approach to word embeddings here like elmo getting more examples this one should usually yield the best results in case the step above is performed but would take time trying different algorithm some algorithms dont really care about class imbalance decision trees and their variants being the most prominent i think you should really check them out starting at simple decision tree than random forest and boosted trees like xgboost lightgbm or catboost the last three should perform quite similar i think xgboost might be best choice due to abundance of materials on this topic different metrics accuracy is not the best one as its highly motivated by the negative class use other metrics like precision and recall and focus on the latter as your algorithm probably does not find enough positive classes weighted loss error made on positive examples would be weighted higher than the one on negative examples i like it better than the next ones as the model tries to accomodate to data here is an example of custom loss in tensorflow upsampling reverse of what you did giving your model same positive examples multiple times each times in this case so there positive examples as much as negatives you do not lose information but training takes longer basically nonexistent problem with your examples total undersampling what you did here but you are losing a lot of information about negative class and its traits better for bigger datasets yours is small creative approaches it is harder with textual data if this wasnt the case you could try dimensionality reduction or other representation of data which could find an underlying cause of difference between positive and negative points hardest and probably would not help in your case can one class svm help doubt it its used for outlier detection data points out of should not be considered an outlier furthermore it may share a lot of features with the negative class and you couldnt make use of the labeled data you currently have if you want to try it anyway there is an implementation in sklearn here
54932155,predict userinput reviews with naive bayes trained model,python scikitlearn userinput textclassification naivebayes,you need to join your words back into a single string right now the output from your inputprocess function is a list of words so your model is interpreting each word as a separate input sample which is why you are getting a score for each word in your review instead of one score for the whole text some changes in your code

54506219,retrain production model with labeled predicted data,machinelearning textclassification trainingdata,i think it is definitely not a good idea by doing so you will basically just improve your models confidence that the predictions are correct what if you add documents that are very different from those in your training set i would rather suggest one of the two things although it seems like your model already has a very good performance if you can manually label a couple of more documents maybe you can come up with a rationale of which you would want to label for instance you could label manually those where the prediction probability is low where the classifier you trained is not very confident about the accuracy of the prediction if you have a lot of unlabeled data and you expect them to behave differently from your training data it might be worth checking out semisupervised learning this would take advantage of both the labeled data and the distribution of the unlabeled data
54354431,spacy text categorization getting the error massage float object is not iterable,python textclassification spacy,according to the documentation first argument of languageupdate accepts a batches of unicode or docs probalby texts contatin some nan values which has a type float related code spacy tries to iterate a nan float and it causes an so you can drop all nan values or replace them with empty string also this kind of error is very frequent for nlp but not only nlp tasks always check out text data for nans and replace them especially when you receive similar error message
54347230,adding an extra dimension to text classification,tensorflow neuralnetwork recurrentneuralnetwork textclassification tensor,i dont think that merging all text together is the solution the problem then is that if you feed it to the lstm it that the hidden states of every text does not start initially so you feed in the first text and then the second and all other texts will have the current hidden state you could use the functional api and create different inputs and give each input its own lstm then you can merge them and have the dense layers at the end another thing that you could try is to use cnn again youd either have to create multiple inputs or concatenate all the inputs and then use cnn layers the advantage here could be the speed because depending on how many lstms you have and how big your input is training can take quite a while especially because the backpropagation also has to go through every timestep so performance wise you may be better off with cnns so what i would do is to keep the arrays separately with a max length then you pad every array to this length if they are to short then you create multiple inputs with the functional api and use convd layers behind it you do some conv operations maybe stack a few conv layers maxpooling etc then you merge them with the concatenate layer and then you have some more dense or cnn
53668101,mutilabel classification,python machinelearning deeplearning textclassification,this is therefore not a classification problem its unsupervised as long as you dont have any label what you can do is to look at kmeans unsupervised machine leaning algorithm that allows you to cluster you data into predefined number of cluster here but you wont have any measure to verify the ground truth if you really want to go further you can try to label these articles yourself with lets say computer science electronics and electrical and try some supervised algorithms with scikitlearn neural net with tensorflow the idea is to vectorize your input data you can take a look at tfidf and then try any supervised model this is called nlp you also have libraries that can help you doing this nltk spacy are a good start
53531824,making a prediction after training and fitting a rnn sequential model,python tensorflow keras neuralnetwork textclassification,the problem seems to be with the tokenizer you cant fit the tokenizer again because you will have different tokens for each word you should fit the tokenizer only once before training and then save the tokens to be used with all new text
53342128,reusing an sklearn text classification model with tfidf feature selection,python machinelearning textclassification tfidf tfidfvectorizer,you cant fit a new vectorizer because you wont be picking the same features as before you need to stop using fittransform and instead use fit save the vectorizer and then run the exact same fitted vectorizer on each data set with transform

52591572,how to classify text documents in legal domain,python svm textclassification wordembedding docvec,docvec is a reasonable way to tranform a variablelength text into a summaryvector and these vectors are often useful for classification especially topical or sentiment classification two applications highlighted in the original paragraph vector paper however docs is extremely small as a training set published work has tended to use corpuses of tensofthousands to millions of documents also your specific classification target predicting a legal judgment strikes me as much harder than topical or sentiment classification knowing how a case will be decided depends on a large body of outside lawprecedent thats not in the trainingset and logical deductions sometimes on individual fine points of a situation those are things the fuzzysummary of a singletextvector are unlikely to capture against that your reported accuracy sounds downright impressive would a lay person do as well with just these summaries i wonder if there are certain tells in the summaries with word choices of the summarizer strongly hinting or downright revealing the actual judgment if thats the strongest signal in the text barring actual domain knowledge logical reasoning you might get justasgood results from a more simple ngramsbagofwords representation and classifier metaoptimizing your training parameters might incrementally improve results but id think youd need a lot more data and perhaps far more advanced learning techniques to really approximate the kind of legallycompetent humanlevel predictions you may be aiming for
52545600,text classification naive bayes python input contains nan infinity or a value too large for dtypefloat,python numpy scikitlearn textclassification naivebayes,i suspect the issue is related to your datadescription and datacategoryid is the first one something like an array with n elements comprising of texts and the second another array like object also with n elements consisting of labels for for the first eg as a test only by replacing your data with some sklearn dataset would produce a correct run try to test that out and let me know if it helps

52438193,prediction giving same value in every iteration in an online multiclass classification using lstm,pythonx tensorflow machinelearning lstm textclassification,it seems that your model learns nothing and only do the random guessing i have below provided few suggestions however may not be the exact reason for the random guessing masking the cost function as explained here it is a good practice to consider only the actual sequence length when you calculating the loss rather than averaging over the padded sequence length following explanation is extracted from the above source note that our output will still be of size batchsize x maxlength x outsize but with the last being zero vectors for sequences shorter than the maximum length when you use the outputs at each time step as in sequence labeling we dont want to consider them in our cost function we mask out the unused frames and compute the mean error over the sequence length by dividing by the actual length using tfreducemean does not work here because it would devide by the maximum sequence length stacking multiple cells following code snippet stacks the same copy of the lstm cell rather than different instances more detail explation can be found herecannot stack lstm with multirnncell and dynamicrnn batch size you are using batch size which is the stochastic gradient descent approach therefore try to increase your batch size mini batch gradient descent approach that would be less noisy and have faster convergence properties try few epochs and see how the loss and the accuracy changes this would give you a good understanding of how your model behaves hope this helps

52018645,how do i determine the binary class predicted by a convolutional neural network on keras,python machinelearning keras deeplearning textclassification,you are doing binary classification so you have a dense layer consisting of one unit with an activation function of sigmoid sigmoid function outputs a value in range which corresponds to the probability of the given sample belonging to positive class ie class one everything below is labeled with zero ie negative class and everything above is labeled with one so to find the predicted class you can do the following the true elements of classone correspond to samples labeled with one ie positive class bonus to find the accuracy of your predictions you can easily compare classone with the true labels note that i have assumed that truelabels consists of zeros and ones further if your model were defined using sequential class then you could easily use predictclasses method however since you are using keras functional api to construct your model which is a very good thing to do so in my opinion you cant use predictclasses method since it is illdefined for such models
51962128,lstm text classification bad accuracy keras,keras lstm textclassification recurrentneuralnetwork multilabelclassification,in last layer the activation function you are using is sigmoid so binarycrossentropy should be used incase you want to use categoricalcrossentropy then use softmax as activation function in last layer now coming to the other part of your model since you are working with text i would tell you to go for tanh as activation function in lstm layers and you can try using lstms dropouts as well like dropout and recurrent dropout you can define units as or start from small number and after testing you take them till you can try adding convolution layer as well for extracting features or use bidirectional lstm but models based bidirectional takes time to train moreover since you are working on text preprocessing of text and size of training data always play much bigger role than expected edited add class weights in fit parameter
51949736,classification with one file with entirely the training and another file with entirely test,python pythonx machinelearning scikitlearn textclassification,the error you are getting in traintestsplit is clearly indicated and solved by alexis and once again i also suggest to not use traintestsplit as it will not do anything except shuffling which you have already done but i want to highlight another important point ie if you are keeping your train and test files separately then just dont fit vectorizers separately it will create different columns for train and test files example output hi is overflow stack this output hi is not overflow stack that hence fitting them separately will result in columns mismatch so you should merge train and test files firstly and then fittransform vectorizer collectively or if you dont have test data beforehand you could only transform the test data using vectorizer fitted on train data which will ignore the words not present in train data

51775834,nltk naivebayesclassifier classifier issues,python nltk textclassification naivebayes,training a sentiment model means that your model learns how words affect the sentiment thus its not about specifying which words are positive and which are negative its about how to train your model to understand that from a text by itself the simplest implementation is called bag of words which is usually used with tfidf normalization bag of words works this way you split your text by words and count occurrences of each word within the given text block or review in this way rows correspond to different reviews and columns correspond to the number of occurrences of the given word within the given review this table becomes your x and the target sentiment to predict becomes your y say for negative and for positive then you train your classifier after the model is trained you can make predictions further reading
51720720,predict a text with bag of word approach,python machinelearning scikitlearn keras textclassification,you need to do this you have not shown how you i tried converting my statement to vector using the count vectorizer but according to the bag of word approach it is just an dimension vector but im guessing you did this if you call fit or fittransform the vectorizer will forget all the previous training and only remember the current vocab hence you only got a feature vector of size whereas your previous vector was of higher size
51646074,convolutional neural network cnn for text classification,text keras deeplearning convneuralnetwork textclassification,generally you do not have to use a dense layer as the outputs of your convolution do contain some spatial information though it might make sense to use one i am assuming that you already understood how a convolution works in that case imagine what the activations at a certain position in the sentence mean with regards to the end result in classification there are even endtoendcnns as for example googlenet which as the name indicates also does not have a fully connected layer

50949318,tensorflow model for text classification,python pythonx tensorflow textclassification tensorflowlite,i think the first step would be to get your hands on or to generate some labelled training data you should look into at feature extraction for example if you notice that for a certain item the second line is usually the price you could represent that as a parameter or say if a number is followed by a unit like mlloz its likely to be the volume what you want to know is how confident you are that a specific linestring is say the price however i think tensorflow would be more suited for the ocr portion of the problem which you have already solved what you are asking is more towards text parsing which could be better solved with an nlp approach

47387959,how to interpret scored probabilities in machine learning classification algorithm,machinelearning neuralnetwork classification probability textclassification,accuracy means out records predictions could go wrong it is not exactly like that accuracy is always although implicitly linked to the specific test set we have used to measure it so means that out of records our classifier indeed misclassified ie there is not could what we hope for in machine learning is that the performance of our models in new unseen data will be comparable to that of our test set which regarding the training of our model is also unseen roughly speaking provided that our new data come from the same statistical distribution with our training test sets it is not an unreasonable expectation what im trying to achieve is to give end your some metric to tell himher that this prediction is probably wrong they might want to change it to some other class before using these results intuitively you should already know the answer to this interpreting the returned probabilities as confidence which at least in principle is not an invalid interpretation their values tell you something about how certain your model is about its answers so what you could do is provide the end users with these probability values in your example the case of question with probability is indeed qualitatively not the same with the case question with probability

46665694,incrementalonline learning using sgdclassifier partialfit method,python machinelearning scikitlearn classification textclassification,i dont think that the saved model size should increase much or maybe at all the model is not storing the whole new data sent to partialfit only updating its attributes based on that data those attributes once assigned some storage space based on their type float float etc will occupy that much space irrespective of their value the notable attributes which will change in sgdclassifier are coef array shape nfeatures if nclasses else nclasses nfeatures weights assigned to the features intercept array shape if nclasses else nclasses constants in decision function so when you initialize the model they are either not assigned or all initialized to once you pass your first data to partialfit these values are updated according to the data trying to minimize the loss over the predictions when you pass the new data these values again get updated but they still occupy the same storage space as designated to their type float float etc so thats the reason the saved model dont have their sizes changed

40275368,cheapest way to classify http post objects,algorithm go machinelearning svm textclassification,yes svm with a linear kernel should be a good starting point you can use scikitlearn it wraps liblinear i believe to train your model after the model is learned the model is simply a list of featureweight for each category you want to classifying into something like this suppose you have only classes at prediction time you dont need scikitlearn at all you can use whatever language you are using on the server backend to do a linear computation suppose a specific post request contains features feature feature what you need to do is like this one step further if you could have some way to define the feature weight eg using tfidf score of tokens then your prediction could become note featureweightfeature k is usually different for each request since for each request the total number of active features must be much smaller than the total number of considered features consider tokens or features vs your entire vocabulary of mm tokens the prediction should be very fast i can imagine once your model is ready an implementation of the prediction could be just written based on a keyvalue store eg redis

39745431,python classify text into the categories,python url machinelearning scikitlearn textclassification,basically you will classify strings into categories therefore you will to use a classifier but you will not just use one classifier but rather test several and chose the most accurate yet firstly you will have to think about features of each url i expect that you will not achieve great accuracy if you are simply feeding the url as a string and as the only feature rather you will preprocess each url to extract features the choice of relevantuseful features strongly depends on the domain a feature could be simple features the first word until the dot such as facebook for facebookcom the length of the whole string complex features imagine you define keywords for each cluster such as for onlineshoppingcluster you will define promo buy shop sell price then you can compute the number of keywords which occur in the string for each cluster as a feature therefore you will have to continue firstly with featureengineering and secondly with a comparing classifier performance additional input similiar question on so regarding url features text feature extraction fast webpage classification using url features edit an example more solutions from here by eiyrio von kauyf yet all these examples are very simple features which do not cover the semantic content of the url depending on the depthsophistication of your target variables clusters you might need to use features ngram based features such as in here
39489197,text classification for multiple label,python machinelearning tensorflow textclassification,the label encoding seems correct if you have multiple correct labels looks totally fine the loss function used in dennys post is tfnnsoftmaxcrossentropywithlogits which is the loss function for a multiclass problem computes softmax cross entropy between logits and labels measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which the classes are mutually exclusive each entry is in exactly one class in multilabel problem you should use tfnnsigmoidcrossentropywithlogits computes sigmoid cross entropy given logits measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which each class is independent and not mutually exclusive for instance one could perform multilabel classification where a picture can contain both an elephant and a dog at the same time the input to the loss function would be logits wx and targets labels fix the accuracy measure in order to measure the accuracy correctly for a multilabel problem the code below needs to be changed the logic of correctpredictions above is incorrect when you could have multiple correct labels for example say numclasses and label and are correct thus your inputy the correctpredictions would need to break tie between index and index i am not sure how tfargmax breaks tie but if it breaks the tie by choosing the smaller index a prediction of label is always considered wrong which definitely hurt your accuracy measure actually in a multilabel problem precision and recall are better metrics than accuracy also you can consider using precisionk tfnnintopk to report classifier performance
39429313,why do tensorflow tflearn classification results vary a lot,machinelearning tensorflow classification deeplearning textclassification,this has nothing to do with tensorflow this dataset is ridiculously small thus you can obtain any results you have points in a space which has infinite amount of dimensions there are around english words thus trigrams however some of them do not exist and for sure they do not exist in your documents but still you have at least dimensions for such problem you have to expect huge variance of the results how can i consistently improve the results apart from collecting more training data you pretty much cannot this is simply way to small sample to do any statistical analysis consequently the best you can do is change evaluation scheme instead of splitting data to do fold cross validation with points this means that you will have to run experiments each with training documents and testing ones and average the result this is the only thing you can do to reduce the variance however remember that even with cv dataset so small gives you no guarantees how well your model will actualy behave in the wild once applied to never seen before data

38256348,onetoone matching to labels for text classification,machinelearning scikitlearn textclassification,to achieve this kind of functionality id suggest you do the following id assume that in your text classification algorithm you obtain a probability score for each document for every label eg you might now be able to see where i am heading towards with this use the argmax function returns the label with the maximum probability for each document in this case the argmax function would return the label new york for the documents the big apple and the the big city the label the big city for the document detroit and the label los angeles for the document city of angels since in this case there is a conflict id rather not call it conflict in assigning a label new york for a document since you require a one to one mapping id say you go to the next label the label the big city can be clearly assigned to the document detroit as it has the maximum probability matching and then you remove the label detroit from the set of possible labels remaining labels new york and los angeles you then move on to the next label los angeles and the argmax function tells you that the document city of angels has the highest probability maximum matching of having the label los angeles you then remove the label lost angeles from the remaining labels at this point remaining labels new york you then go to the next label new york and see that the only document it can be assigned to is the big apple and you have a onetoone mapping between the documents and the labels i have done this before in two ways breaking a tie by assigning a label to a document randomly or by breaking the tie by calculating the probability for the next label this technique is also used in a decision tree algorithm to find the most suitable attribute at a given level in the tree it is called as the entropy or the information gain of that attribute this implementation is a simpler version of the information gain from the id decision tree algorithm more about the id decision tree algorithm here

37345314,complication using logprobabilities naive bayes text classifier,python math statistics textclassification naivebayes,i think you may be best to keep everything in logs the first part of this to compute the log of the product is just adding up the log of the terms the second bit computing the log of the sum of the exponentials of the logs is a bit trickier one way would be to store each of the logs of the products in an array and then you need a function that given an array l with n elements will compute one way to do this is to find the maximum m say of the ls a little algebra shows each of the terms lim is nonpositive so overflow cant occur underflow is not a problem as for them exp will return at least one of them the one where li is m will be zero so its exp will be one and well end up with something we can pass to log in other words the evaluation of the formula will be trouble free if you have the function logp logpx logx then you could gain some accuracy by omitting the just one i where li m from the sum and passing the sum to logp instead of log

37086414,text classification with r and svm matrix features,r machinelearning svm textclassification,regardless of the specifics of the library my question is is there any technique in document classification to ensure that the fact that training documents and new documents have different words will not prevent new data from being classified yes and it is very trivial one before applying any training or classification you create a preprocessing object which is supposed to map text to your vector representation in particular it stores whole vocabulary used for training later on you reuse the same preprocessing object on test documents and you simply ignore words from outside of vocabulary stored before oov words as they are often refered in the literature obviously there are plenty other more heuristic approaches where instead of discarding you try to map them to existing words although it is less theoreticalyy justified rather you should create intermediate representation which will be your new preprocessing object which can handle oov words through some levenstein distance mapping etc
36821818,svm feature vector representation by using premade dictionary for text classification,machinelearning svm sentimentanalysis textclassification,in short this is not the way it works the whole point of learning is to give classifier ability to assign these weights on their own you cannot force it to have a high value per class for a particular feature i mean you could on the optimization level but this would require changing the whole svm structure so the right way is to simply create a normal representation without any additional specification let the model decide they are better at statistical analysis than human intuition really
36687929,similarity measure scikitlearn document classification,python scikitlearn textclassification,as with most supervised learning algorithms random forest classifiers do not use a similarity measure they work directly on the feature supplied to them so decision trees are built based on the terms in your tfidf vectors if you want to use similarity then you will have to compute a similarity matrix for your documents and use this as your features
36610526,machine learning text classification where a text belongs to to n classes,machinelearning statistics textclassification naivebayes,yes this makes sense it is a well known basic technique for multilabelmulticlass classification known as one vs all or one vs all classifier this is very old and widely used on the other hand it is also very naive as you do not consider any relations between your classestags you might be interested in reading about structure learning which covers topics where there is some structure over labels space that can be exploited and usually there is
36323759,multiclass classification with naive bayes and r,r machinelearning textclassification naivebayes,there are conceptually two approaches you combine the tag into a combined tag then you would get the joint probability the main drawback is the combinatorial explosion which implies that you also need much more training data you build a individual nb model for each tag as always in probabilistic modelling is the question whether you assume that your tags are independent or not in the spirit of naive bayes the independence assumption would be very natural in that case would be the way to go if the independence assumption is not justified and you are afraid of the combinatorial explosion you can use a standard bayesian network if you keep certain assumptions your performance will not be impacted however you could also assume a mixed a approach you could use a hierarchical naive bayes model if there is some logical structure in the tags you can introduce a parent variable for the classes bascially you have a value tagtag if both tags occur together the basic idea can be extended towards a latent variable you do not observer this can be trained using a em scheme this will slightly impact your training performance as you need to run the training multiple iteration however will probably give you the best results

35254526,text classifier with bag of words and additional sentiment feature in sklearn,python scikitlearn textclassification,one option would be to just add these two new features to your countvectorizer matrix as columns as you are not performing any tfidf your count matrix is going to be filled with integers so you could encode your new columns as int values you might have to try several encodings but you can start with something like sentiment transformed to string with topic of sentence just assign integers to different topics unicorns batman you can keep a dictionary structure to assign integers and avoid repeating topics and just in case you dont know how to add columns to your trainmatrix note that the column valvaln needs to have the same lenght as num samples you are using even though it wont be strictly a bag of words anymore because not all columns represent word frequency just adding this two columns will add up the extra information you want to include and naive bayes classifier considers each of the features to contribute independently to the probability so we are okay here update better use a one hot encoder to encode categorical features this way you prevent weird behavior by assigning integer values to your new features maybe you can still do that with sentiment because in a scale of sentiment from to you assume that a sentiment is closer to a sample with sentiment rather than another with sentiment but with categorical features you better do the onehot encoding so lets say you have topics then you can use same technique of adding columns only now you have to add instead of one topictopictopic this way if you have a sample that belongs to topic youll encode this as if thats topic your representation is you mark with the column that corresponds to the topic
34578423,how can i compute f measure for each class in multiclass classification,machinelearning nltk computerscience textclassification,the problem here is that the f measure is imho not really meaningful for multiclass problems it is the harmonic mean between precision and recall precision is the probability that a randomly selected positive classified instance is positive recall is the probability that a randomly selected positive instance is classified as positive these definition are inherently binary typically id give the f measure for each of the classes separately this allows you to also decide which kinds of failures are acceptable for you from my personal experience i would actually give precision and recall in you example the classification of a ham email as spam would be extremely harmful hence precision on spam is way more important than recall for a more broad overview also containing a list of measures you can check also

27712040,text classifier with weka how to correctly train a classifier issue,java weka textclassification categorization,it seems like you changed the code from the website you referenced in some crucial points but not in a good way ill try to draft what youre trying to do and what mistakes ive found what you probably wanted to do in extractfeature is split each tweet into words tokenize count the number of occurrences of these words create a feature vector representing these word counts plus the class what youve overlooked in that method is you never reset your featuremap the line originally was at the beginning extractfeatures but you moved it to initialize that means that you always add up the word counts but never reset them for each new tweet your word count also includes the word count of all previous tweets im sure that is not what you wanted you dont initialize featurewords with the words you want as features yes you create an empty list but you fill it iteratively with each tweet the original code initialized it once in the initialize method and it never changed after that there are two problems with that with each new tweet new features words get added so your feature vector grows with each tweet that wouldnt be such a big problem sparseinstance but that means that your class attribute is always in another place these two lines work for the original code because featurewordssize is basically a constant but in your code the class label will be at index then then and so on but it must be the same for every instance this also manifests itself in the fact that you build a new attributelist with each new tweet instead of only once in initialize which is bad for already explained reasons there may be more stuff but as it is your code is rather unfixable what you want is much closer to the tutorial source code which you modified than your version also you should look into stringtowordvector because it seems like this is exactly what you want to do converts string attributes into a set of attributes representing word occurrence depending on the tokenizer information from the text contained in the strings the set of words attributes is determined by the first batch filtered typically training data
27689953,how can i complete the text classification task using less memory,python memory numpy scikitlearn textclassification,the main problem youre facing is that youre using far too many features its actually quite extraordinary that youve managed to generate features from documents that contain just words ive seen svm classifiers separate spam from nonspam with high accuracy using just features word counts of selected words that say a lot about whether the document is spam these use stemming and other normalization tricks to make the features more effective you need to spend some time thinning out your features think about which features are most likely to contain information useful for this task experiment with different features as long as you keep throwing everything but the kitchen sink in youll get memory errors right now youre trying to pass data points with dimensions each to your svm thats gigabytes conservatively of data my computer only has gigabytes of ram youve got to pare this way down a first step towards doing so would be to think about how big your total vocabulary size is each document has only words but lets say those words are taken from a vocabulary of words that means there will be possible grams thats half a quadrillion possible grams of course not all those grams will appear in your documents but this goes a long way towards explaining why youre running out of memory do you really need these grams could you get away with grams only there are a measly million possible grams that will fit much more easily in memory even if all possible grams appear unlikely also keep in mind that even if the svm could handle quadrillions of datapoints it would probably give bad results because when you give any learning algorithm too many features it will tend to overfit picking up on irrelevant patterns and overgeneralizing from them there are ways of dealing with this but its best not to deal with it at all if you can help it i will also mention that these are not newbie problems these are problems that machine learning specialists with phds have to deal with they come up with lots of clever solutions but were not so clever that way so we have to be clever a different way although i cant offer you specific suggestions for cleverness without knowing more i would say that first stemming is a good idea in at least some cases stemming simply removes grammatical inflection so that different forms of the same word swim and swimming are treated as identical this will probably reduce your vocabulary size significantly at least if youre dealing with english text a common choice is the porter stemmer which is included in nltk as well as in a number of other packages also if you arent already you should probably strip punctuation and reduce all words to lowercase from there it really depends stylometry identifying authors sometimes requires only particles a an the conjunctions and but and other very common words spam on the other hand has its own oddball vocabularies of interest at this level it is very difficult to say in advance what will work youll almost certainly need to try different approaches to see which is most effective as always testing is crucial well possibly you have a huge amount of ram at your disposal for example i have access to a machine with g of ram at my current workplace but i doubt it could handle this either because the svm will have its own internal representation of the data which means there will be at least one copy at some point if a second copy is needed at any point kaboom

24030354,text classification scheme for a classification task with classes,weka svm textclassification,i assume that classes are not overlapping that is exactly one class per message a useful approach in the case of imbalanced classes is using asymetric missclassification costs in order to enforce the classifier to focus on the less represented class as its cost is assigned much bigger figure than other classes this is relatively easy to do in weka see eg class imbalanced distribution and weka cost sensitive learning in the case of binary classifiers but it is much harder to setup in the case of classes in consequence one approach would be to turn this problem into binary problems oneagainsttherest and setting up the appropriate cost matrixes for each problem a more viable alternative in my experience and given the high number of classes is to collapse the unfrequent classes into a bigger other class this seems more useful for a practical setting there is a other folder to check by a human expert while most of the time the classifier is correctly assigning the emails to the rest of well populated classes as a final note an accuracy of about may be not to bad after all depending on the distribution of classes for instance the majority classifier the one that assigns every instance to the most populated class in a would be accurate however it is absolutely useless because it misses the interesting examples in the real life this happens in email spam filtering fraud spotting and quite many other domains

20315897,ngrams vs other classifiers in text categorization,machinelearning datamining classification ngram textclassification,ill actually post a full answer to this since i think its worth it being obvious that you can use ngram models as classifiers in much the same way as you can use any probability model of your features as one generative classifiers approximate the posterior of interest pclass test doc as pct propto pc ptc where pc is the prior probability of c and ptc is the likelihood classification picks the argmax over all c an ngram language model just like naive bayes or lda or whatever generative model you like can be construed as a probability model ptc if you estimate a separate model for each class as such it can provide all the information required to do classification the question is whether the model is any use of course the major issue is that ngram models tend to be built over billions of words of text where classifiers are often trained on a few thousand you can do complicated stuff like putting joint priors on the parameters of all the class models clamping hyperparameters to be equal what these parameters are depends on how you do smoothing but its still tricky an alternative is to build an ngram model of characters including spacespunctuation if it turns out to be useful this can be estimated much more reliably parameters for trigram model instead of and can be very useful for author identificationgenre classificationother forms of classification that have stylistic elements

17490361,learning validation and testing classifier,machinelearning textclassification,in your example i dont think there is a meaningful distinction between validation and testing learning is when you train the model which means that your outputs are in general parameters such as coefficients in a regression model or weights for connections in a neural network in your case the outputs are estimated probabilities for the probability of seeing a word w in a tweet given the tweet positive pw seeing a word given negative pw and seeing a word given neutral pw also the probabilities of not seeing words in the tweet given positive negative neutral pw etc the inputs are the training data and the process is simply estimating probabilities by measuring the frequencies that words occur or dont occur in each of your classes ie just counting testing is where you see how well your trained model does on data you havent seen before training tends to produce outputs that overfit the training data ie the coefficients or probabilities are tuned to noise in the training data so you need to see how well your model does on data it hasnt been trained on in your case the inputs are the test examples the process is applying bayes theorem and the outputs are classifications for the test examples you classify based on which probability is highest i have come across crossvalidation in addition to testing in situations where you dont know what model to use or where there are additional extrinsic parameters to estimate that cant be done in the training phase you split the data into sets so for example in linear regression you might want to fit a straight line model ie estimate p and c in y px c or you might want to fit a quadratic model ie estimate p c and q in y px qx c what you do here is split your data into three you train the straight line and quadratic models using part of the data the training examples then you see which model is better by using part of the data the crossvalidation examples finally once youve chosen your model you use part of the data the test set to determine how good your model is regression is a nice example because a quadratic model will always fit the training data better than the straight line model so cant just look at the errors on the training data alone to decide what to do in the case of naive bayes it might make sense to explore different prior probabilities ie p p p using a crossvalidation set and then use the test set to see how well youve done with the priors chosen using crossvalidation and the conditional probabilities estimated using the training data as an example of how to calculate the conditional probabilities consider tweets which have been classified as or by a human t contains hate anger t contains dont hate t contains love friend t contains anger so for phate you add up the number of times hate appears in negative tweets it appears in t but not in t so phate for phate you do the opposite hate doesnt appear in out of of the negative tweets so phate similar calculations give panger and plove a fly in the ointment is that any probability that is will mess things up in the calculation phase so you instead of using a zero probability you use a very low number like n or n where n is the number of training examples so you might put panger or the maths of the calculation i put in this answer

16266842,maxent classifier nltk output understand,python machinelearning nltk textclassification,it seems that you have two labels relevant and irrelevant when there are two labels one is normally named or positive and the other or negative during the training process the classifier analysed the features of the training instances and weighted them according to their ability to distinguish well between the two labels the details of the weighting process depend on the algorithm you chose poitive precision of the testing instances that were classified as label during the testing really have the label positive recall of the label instances in the testing set were found ie classified as label negative precision negative recall is the same but for label accuracy of the testing instances were labeled correctly the features are sorted according to their absolute value which corresponds to their relevance for the classification the most helpful feature in this case was need and if it is true this is a very good hint that the label of the instance should be relevant

73655387,spacy example object format for spancategorizer,initialization spacy,if you wantneed to create example objects directly the easiest way to do so is to use the function examplefromdict which takes a predicted doc and a dict predicted in this context is a doc with partial annotations representing data from previous components for many usecases it can just be a clean doc created with nlpmakedoctext what this function does is taking the annotations from the dict and using those to define the goldstandard that is now stored in the example object eg if you print this object using spacy youll see the internal representation of those goldstandard annotations docannotation cats entities o o o o o spans myspans loc loc doubleloc links tokenannotation orth i like london and berlin spacy true true true true false tag lemma pos morph head dep sentstart ps the parsegolddoc function in the docs is just a placeholderdummy function well clarify that in the docs to avoid confusion
73401971,for spacys ner do i need to label the entire word as an entity,python spacy namedentityrecognition,you cant put an ner label on half a token the tokenizer is run before ner and the ner component attempts to give a label to each whole token so if youre only interested in part of a token the ner component wont be able to figure that out if you dont have some way to separate the tokens in preprocessing it seems like the only thing you can do is label the whole token youre right that will make it harder for the model to learn one alternative is to try training a characterlevel ner component basically split your input into individual characters before training
73358922,spacy spans labels how to add spans with a particular lable to a doc,python spacy,docspans is like a dictionary where each key is a string and each value is a spangroup which is basically a list of spans the reason docspans is a dictionary instead of just a single list of spans is so that you can have different components add lists of spans for different reasons or have a single component add different groups of spans for example if you a coreference component it could use one spangroup for each cluster where a cluster is lists of spans that refer to the same thing for the sentence john smith called from new york he said its raining there john smith he would be one cluster and new york there would be another if you had a spancat component and also a coref component they would both need to set spans on the doc but you wouldnt want those spans to get mixed up docspans allows you to keeps things clean and separate
72346631,highlight text parts based on labels,python spacy highlight,im not entirely sure what youre asking but you can put entities of your own on the spacy doc object and pass them to displacy to simply set entities manually you can do this if you have word list and need to look for words you can use rulebased matching with an entityruler check the rulebased matching guide

68492541,is it possible to add custom entity labels to spacy config file,spacy spacy spacytransformers,if you are working with the configbased training generally you should not have to specify the labels anywhere spacy will look at the training data and get the list of labels from there there are a few cases where this wont work you have labels that arent in your training data these cant be learned so i would just consider this an error but sometimes you have to work with the data youve been given you training data is very large in this case reading over all the training data to get a complete list of labels can be an issue you can use the init labels command to generate data so that the input data doesnt have to be scanned every time you start training
68042603,spacy what dataset format to categorize labels,spacy multilabelclassification spacy,you asked the same question on the spacy forum but ill go ahead and answer here the format is the same no matter how many labels you have is there a reason you though otherwise i dont think we said there was a limit anywhere also note the json format is not a fixed format the important thing is creating the doc object before serializing it there are many ways to do that but there are examples in the spacy tutorial projects

66935361,why spacy doesnt recognise all named entities in the label,pythonx spacy,it looks like youre using spacy v the issue here is that because youve used the textin structure youre only matching single tokens because your targets have punctuation in them its probably getting split into multiple tokens and therefore not matching one of the advantages of the entityruler is that you dont have to worry about how the tokenizer works if you just hand the pattern over heres how you can do that in which case all your entities are matched
65134056,ner should i include common prefixes in labeled entities,spacy namedentityrecognition,it depends on the neural network architecture you use lets assume you use spacy v and its default neural architecture which is a cnn in this case the architecture is going to slide through your text according to a specific window ie x number of words before the date entity and x number of words after the date entity with this approach every time the token date appears in the text it is likely that the neural network will recognize that the entity date sits next to it in this case my suggestion would be to include only the annotate the xxxxxxxx date as an entity it will give the model more flexibility in determining what is a date entity however testing is always the best way to find out whats best so give it a try

60922171,spacy entity linker why is the predict score a combination of prob and cosine sim,python spacy entitylinking,it is taken from entity linking via joint encoding of types descriptions and context section equation i dont feel confident enough though in explaining the formula in detail on overall the purpose is to combine probability scores for entitiy candidates derived from external knowledge based resources kb in the paper which are the prior probabilities and scores estimated with a sentence encoder used to encode the mention to link along with its context sims in the formula because they compute cosine similarity between the encoded mention vector and all entity candidates which is why this formula is used only if inclcontext is true
60502140,how to set the sentiment attribute on a span,spacy,you can find the implementation of spansentiment here you can see it is indeed not writable because it either looks up the value in selfdocuserspanhooks or takes the average of tokensentiment for the tokens in that span edited below the sentiment of a token is not contextdependent though it uses the information present in the underlying lexeme that means that any word such as love would have the same sentiment value in any sentencecontext so theres two things you can do either write to the sentiment of the lexemes like so or implement a custom hook that allows you to define any function you want you can do this on the span docuserspanhooks or token docusertokenhooks level
60176633,does the notation of a named entity label type in spacy have to match with the notation of the annotated label type in the training data,spacy trainingdata namedentityrecognition webanno,yes of course you want to keep annotations aligned if its a oneoff operation it might be easiest to bruteforce the problem by replacing the string in your data the more canonical option would appear to be tagmap quote you need to define how your tags map down to the universal dependencies tag set their example

57363275,how does textcategorizerpredict work with spacy,label classification spacy predict,the predict methods of pipeline components actually expect a doc as input so youll need to do something like textcatpredictnlptext the nlp used there does not necessarily have a textcat component the result of that call then needs to be fed into a call to setannotations as shown here however your first approach is just fine internally when calling nlptext first the doc for the text will be generated and then each pipeline component one by one will run its predict method on that doc and keep adding information to it with setannotations eventually the textcat component will define the cats variable of the doc the api docs from which youre citing for the other approach kind of give you a look under the hood so theyre not really conflicting approaches

58081552,how to use docvec to assign labels to enron dataset,python nltk docvec,docvec requires a lot of data to train useful dense embedding vectors for texts its not likely to give good results with just a handful of training texts as with your short commontexts even if you reduce the vectorsize to just dimensions published docvec work often uses tensofthousands to millions of training documents to train docvectors with dimensions but then further these vectors do not have each of their individual dimensions as interpretable categories rather they are dense vectors where theres no a priori assignment of meaning to individual axes instead all training docs are packed into a shared space where their relative distances or relative directions may indicate strengthofrelationships so your code to pick a label for each document based on which dimension of its docvector is the largest positive value is a nonsensical misuse of docvecstyle vectors it would help to more clearly state your actual goals what kind of labels are you trying to assign and why in particular it would be more appropriate to train the docvec model on all the email texts if you have knownlabels for some of the emails but then want to figure out labels for other emails then use the docvectors as an input to a separate classification step if you dont have knownlabels but want to discover what sorts of natural groupings might exist in the emails as modeled by docvec then youd use the docvectors as an input to a separate clustering step and then further examineanalyze the resulting clusters to see if theyre sensible for your needs or reveal patterns interesting to your project there are many online tutorial examples using python machinelearning tools to classify emails from the enron dataset id suggest successfully working through one or more of those even if they dont use docvec to understand the general classifiertraining then classifertesting and finally classifierapplication process only then consider docvec as an extra source of features to add to the classification effort

56204063,twitter sentiment analysis with naive bayes classify only returning neutral label,python nltk,your dataset is highly imbalanced you yourself mentioned it in one of the comment you have positive and negative labelled tweets but neutral thats why it always favours the majority class you should have equal number of utterances for all classes if possible you also need to learn about evaluation metrics then youll see most probably your recall is not good an ideal model should stand good on all evaluation metrics to avoid overfitting some people also add a fourth others class as well but for now you can skip that heres something you can do to improve performance of your model either add more data oversample the minority classes by adding possible similar utterances or undersample the majority class or use a combination of both you can read about oversampling undersampling online in this new datset try to have utterances of all classes in this ratio if possible finally try other algos as well with hyperparameters tuned through grid searchrandom search or tpot edit in your case irrelevant is the others class so you now have classes try to have dataset in this ratio for each class
55792897,too many values to unpack valueerror while training classifier,python nltk,the reason is pretty simple naivebayesclassifier expects an iterable of tuples comprising a featureset and a label for example in your context the positive word featureset would be something like this accordingly the data you should be feeding to naivebayesclassifier should be of this form however if you look at the wider context of what youre doing i am not sure this really makes sense for a few reasons the principal one is that you actually dont have a way to decide what those scores are in the first place you seem to be doing sentiment analysis the simplest and most common way is to download a pretrained mapping from words to sentiment scores so you could try that the second is that the featureset is meant as a mapping from feature values to labels if you look at the nltk official example the featureset looks something like this the workflow here takes a name generates a single feature from it the last letter and then uses the last letter of each name in conjunction with whether it is male or female the label to determine the conditional probability of a names gender given its last letter on the other hand what youre doing is attempting to decide if a sentence is positive or negative which means that you need simplifying here to tell if each individual word is positive or negative however if so then both your feature and your label mean the exact same thing

50273626,how to use machine learning algorithm to predict most discussed tweeter category,python machinelearning nltk multilabelclassification,this is not necessarily a good application for machine learning essentially youre analyzing each word in a tweet and seeing if that word belongs in a predefined category machine learning might be used for something like sentiment analysis where it can learn that individual words or groups of words convey a certain feeling but to classify individual words doesnt really make sense you would be trying to train a model to learn definitions of words i think your approach with the dictionary is viable and much easier to accomplish for each category you care about add a few words and then you can use a thesaurus api to programmatically find synonyms for each word in the category to expand the vocabulary of your dictionary
49484820,text categorization test nltk python,python nltk textmining naivebayes,just saving the model will not help you should also save your vectormodel like tfidfvectorizer or countvectorizer what ever you have used for fitting the train data you can save those the same way using pickle also save all those models you used for preprocessing the train data like normalizationscaling models etc for the test data repeat the same steps by loading the pickle models that you saved and transform the test data in train data format that you used for model building and then you will be able to classify
49482417,how to solve a notimplementederror from nltkclassify classifieri,python nltk,as noted in the comments theres some bad spaghetti like code in the classiferi api that has classify calling classifymany when overriden it might not be a bad thing when considering that the classifieri is strongly tied with the naivebayesclassifier object but for the particular use in the op the spaghetti code there isnt welcomed tldr take a look at in long from the traceback the error is starts from nltkclassifyutilaccuracy calling the classifiericlassify the classifiericlassify is generally used to classify one document and the input is a dictionary of featureset with its binary values the classifiericlassifymany is supposed to classify a multiple documents and the input is a list of dictionary of featureset with its binary values so the quick hack is to overwrite how the accuracy function so that the votedclassifier wont be dependent on the classifieri definition of classify vs classifymany that would also mean that we dont inherit from classifieri imho if you dont need other functions other than classify theres no need to inherit the baggage that classifieri might come with now if we call the new myaccuracy with the new votedclassifier object out note theres certain randomness when it comes to shuffling the document and then holding out a set to test for the classifier accuracy my suggestion is to do the following instead of simple randomshuffledocuments repeat the experiments with various random seed for each random seed do a fold cross validation
49097979,valueerror too many values to unpack nltk classifier,python machinelearning nltk naivebayes,nltkclassifier doesnt work like scikit estimators it requires the x and y both in a single array which is then passed to train but in your code you are only supplying it the xtrain and it tries to unpack y from that and hence the error the naivebayesclassifier requires the input to be a list of tuples where list denotes the training samples and the tuple has the feature dictionary and label inside something like you need to change your input to this format note the above for loop can be shortened by using dict comprehension but im not that fluent there then you can do this

46391559,word classification using machine learning algorithm,machinelearning nltk svm naivebayes nltktrainer,you need both positive and negative data to train a classifier it wouldnt be hard to add a bunch of english text or whatever the likely alternatives are in your domain but you need to read up on how an nltk classifier actually works or youll only be able to handle words that youve seen in your training data you need to select and extract features that the classifier will use to do its job so from the comments you want to categorize individual words as being malayalam or not if your features are whole words you are wasting your time with a classifier just make a python set of malayalam words and check if your inputs are in it to go the classifier route youll have to figure out what makes a word look malayalam to you endings length syllable structure and manually turn these properties into features so that the classifier can decide how important they are a better approach for language detection is to use letter trigrams every language has a different profile of common and uncommon trigrams you can google around for it or code your own i had good results with cosine similarity as a measure of distance between the sample text and the reference data in this question youll see how to calculate cosine similarity but for unigram counts use trigrams for language identification two benefits of the trigram approach you are not dependent on familiar words or on coming up with clever features and you can apply it to stretches of text longer than a single word even after filtering out english which will give you more reliable results the nltks langid corpus provides trigram counts for hundreds of common languages but its also easy enough to compile your own statistics see also nltkutiltrigrams

44522536,german stemming for sentiment analysis in python nltk,python nltk sentimentanalysis stemming snowball,as a computer scientist you are definitely looking in the right direction to tackle this linguistic issue stemming is usually quite a bit more simplistic and used for information retrieval tasks in an attempt to decrease the lexicon size but usually not sufficient for more sophisticated linguistic analysis lemmatisation partly overlaps with the use case for stemming but includes rewriting for example verb inflections all to the same root form lemma and also differentiating work as a noun and work as a verb although this depends a bit on the implementation and quality of the lemmatiser for this it usually needs a bit more information like postags syntax trees hence takes considerably longer rendering it less suitable for ir tasks typically dealing with larger amounts of data in addition to germanet didnt know it was aborted but never really tried it because it is free but you have to sign an agreement to get access to it there is spacy which you could have a look at very easy to install and use see install instructions on the website then download the german stuff using then as you can see unfortunately it doesnt do a very good job on your specific example suchen and im not sure what the number represents ie must be the lemma id but not sure what other information can be obtained from this but maybe you can give it a go and see if it helps you

41468975,sentiment classification with nltk naive baysian classifier,python nltk,looking at the nltk book page it seems the data that is given to the naivebayesclassifier is of the type listtupledictstr whereas the data you are passing to the classifier is of the type listdict if you represent the data in a similar manner you will get different results basically it is a list of feature dict label there are multiple errors in your code python does not use a semicolon as a line ending the true boolean does not seem to serve a purpose on line trainfeatlist and testfeatlist should be lists each value in your feature items list should betupledictstr assign labels to features in the list in take naivebayesclassifier and any use of classifier out of the negative features loop if you fix the previous errors the classifier will work but unless i know what you are trying to achieve it is confusing and does not predict well the main line you need to pay attention to is when you assign something to your variable value for example should be something like then afterwards you would call append on your lists to add each value instead of update you can look at an example of your updated code in a buggy working state at but i would suggest thinking about the following how is the data supposed to be represented for the naivebayesclassifier class what features are you trying to capture what labels are associated with those features
40979675,classifying text strings into multiple classes using naive bayes with nltk,python pandas nltk naivebayes,im treating your selfanswer as part of your question presumably you got the probability of the classification bird like this here probcat is an nltk probability distribution probdist you can get all categories in a discrete probdist and their probability like this since you already know the categories you trained with you can use a predefined list instead of probcatsamples finally you can order them from the most to the least probable in the same expression
40967392,naive bayesian classification using nltk,python class types classification nltk,you always get the most frequent category back because you are not giving your classifier any useful features to work with if you have to guess with no evidence at all the most common class is the right answer the classifier can only reason about feature names and feature values it has seen before new data consists of known features in combinations that it has not seen before but your code only defines one feature q and the value in each case is the entire text of the question so all test questions are unknown and therefore indistinguishable feature values you cant get something for nothing learn how to train a classifier and how classification works while youre at it and the problem will go away
40447335,how can nltk naivebayes classifier learn more featuresets after the train ends,pythonx machinelearning classification nltk naivebayes,two things naive bayes is usually super fast it only visits all your training data for one time and accumulates the featureclass cooccurrence stats after that it uses that stats to build the model usually its not a problem to just retrain your model with new incremental data its doable to not redo the steps above when new data comes as long as you still have the featureclass stats stored somewhere now you just visit the new data the same way as you did in step and keep updating the featureclass cooccurrence stats at the end of day you have new numerators m and denominators n which applies to both class priors pc and the probability of feature given a class pwc you could derive the probabilities by mn friendly reminder of bayesian formulas in document classification given a document d the probability that the document falls in category of cj is that probability is proportional to based on naive bayes assumption all words eg w w wk in the doc are independent throwing away pd because every class have the same pd as denominator thus we say proportional not equal to now all probabilities on the right side could be computed by a corresponding fraction mn where m and n are stored or can be derived in the featureclass cooccurrence matrix

36966184,nltk classifier object,python nltk,the classifier needs to be trained on the whole data set the trainingset in your code for you to be able to make correct predictions and tests on the testingset since training more than one classifiers with parts of the dataset will not work or at least it will not be the optimal solution i would suggest the following things try to solve the memory error if you are running on windows and python bit take a look at this try to optimize your code data and maybe use less features or represent them in a more spacememory efficient way if and dont work and want to combine many classifier objects to one but only when it comes to their predictions you could try ensemble methods but i really believe that this is besides the point of what you are trying to do and is not going to fix the issue you are facing in any case heres an example of a maxvote classifier
36727005,python loaded nltk classifier not working,python nltk pickle sentimentanalysis naivebayes,the most likely place a pickled classifier can go wrong is with the feature extraction function this must be used to generate the feature vectors that the classifier works with the naivebayesclassifier expects feature vectors for both training and classification your code looks as if you passed the raw words to the classifier instead but presumably only after unpickling otherwise you wouldnt get different behavior before and after unpickling you should store the feature extraction code in a separate file and import it in both the training and the classifying or testing script i doubt this applies to the op but some nltk classifiers take the feature extraction function as an argument to the constructor when you have separate scripts for training and classifying it can be tricky to ensure that the unpickled classifier successfully finds the same function this is because of the way pickle works pickling only saves data not code to get it to work just put the extraction function in a separate file module that your scripts import if you put in in the main script pickleload will look for it in the wrong place

27246917,my maxent classifier works fine with gis algorithm but does not work with iis algorithm it is not throwing any error just some warnings,python nltk maxent,firstly the way youre importing your libraries unsorted is too confusing also there are lot of unused imports after some googling so lets cut down the imports and stick with this then i found that featx is some example module the jacob perkins was using for his book this is a better source so lets heres a documented version with some explanation of what the functions are doing now lets go through the process of training the model and testing it first the feature extraction lets see what we get after calling labelfeatsfromcorpus out so we get a document with the neg label and for each word in our document we see that all words are true for now each document only contains the feature ie the word that it has lets move on now we see that the splitlabelfeats change the key value structure such that each iteration of trainfeats gives us a document with a tuple of the features label out so it seems like the error can only be caused by your last two lines of code when you run the line you get these warnings but do note that the code is still building the model so its just warnings due to underflow see what are arithmetic underflow and overflow in c it takes a while to build the classifier but fear not just wait till its finish and dont ctr c to end the python process if you kill the process you will see this so lets understand why the warning occurs there are warnings given all of them points to the same function used to calculate delta in nltks maxent implementation ie and you find out that the this delta calculation is specific to iis improved iterative scaling algorithm at this point you need to learn about machine learning and supervised learning to answer your question the warming is merely an indication that delta is hard to calculate at some point but its still reasonable to deal with possibly because of some super small values when calculating delta the algorithm is working its not hanging its training in order to appreciate the neat implementation of maxent in nltk i suggest you go through this course or for more hardcore machine learning course go to training a classifier takes time and computing juice and after you wait long enough you should see that it does out you can see that the accuracy is bad as expected since delta calculation is going too far is your baseline go through the courses as listed above and you should be able to produce better classifiers after knowing how they come about and how to tune them btw remember to pickle your classifier so that you dont have to retrain it the next time see save naive bayes trained classifier in nltk and pickling a trained classifier yields different results from the results obtained directly from a newly but identically trained classifier heres the full code
27203056,finderapplyngramfilter in nltkcollocations to classify some ngrams,python pythonx nltk,the most common use of bigramcollocationfinder is to find top ranking ngrams eg out now we see how the finder works we want more complex functions to clean out results let try to get rid of these nasty trigrams like usea u utwelve and uvalley u umelchizedek seems like a in the middle of a trigram usually doesnt give a linguistically interesting ngram so lets try to get rid of them when we rank them out seems like we clean out the trgram we didnt want but that nasty u goes into third position lets get it of it once and for all out yeah now the nasty ngrams are gone seems like we just need to give a condition in the lambda function and it will clean out the ones we dont want when ranking them indeed it is see and this the lambda looks a little complex but actually its just a condition thats doing something like this its not exactly doing the following but you can understand it as such so lets go back to your question lets say our blacklist ngrams are first you got to tuplize them if theyre not with this out voila alternatively you can also use this function if you dont want to tuplize your ngrams the following yield the same output so heres the full script if you want to do the reverse its normally call a whitelist simply do
26976362,how to get most informative features for scikitlearn classifier for different class,python machinelearning scikitlearn nltk,in the case of binary classification it seems like the coefficient array has been flatten lets try to relabel our data with only two labels out so lets do some diagnostics out seems like the features are counted and then when vectorized it was flattened to save memory so lets try out now we see some patterns seems like the higher coefficient favors a class and the other tail favors the other so you can simply do this out actually if youve read larsmans comment carefully he gave the hint on the binary classes coefficient in how to get most informative features for scikitlearn classifiers
26899025,sklearnclassifier object has no attribute vectorizer,python scikitlearn nltk pickle,this type of problem is a known issue with sklearn i have had the same general issue depickling trained sklearn models after updating to the latest version of the package for whatever reason there is often not enough consistency between versions such that you can reliably depickle a trained model from a prior version when you originally pickled the trained classifier it serialized a call to a function under the hood that is itself not serialized so when you depickle it deserializes the call but makes the call to the new version of that function which no longer takes the same arguments or has the same attributes in your case vectorizer you have two options retrain the model with the new version or install the prior version you were using rather than the most up to date version of sklearn
26213496,twitterfacebook comments classification into various categories,python facebook twitter machinelearning nltk,this answer can be a bit long and perhaps i abstract a few things away but its just to give you an idea and some advice supervised vs unsupervised as others already mentioned in the land of machine learning there are main roads supervised and unsupervised learning as you probably already know by now if your corpusdocuments are labeled you are talking about supervised learning the labels are the categories and are in this case boolean values for instance if a text is related to clothes and shoes the labels for those categories should be true since a text can be related to multiple categories multiple labels we are looking at multiclassifiers what to use i presume that the dataset is not yet labeled since twitter does not do this categorisation for you so here comes a big decision on your part you label the data manually which means you try to look at as much tweetsfb messages in your dataset and for each of them you consider the categories and answer them by truefalse you decide to use a unsupervised learning algorithm and hope that you discover these categories since approaches like clustering will just try to find categories on their own and these dont have to match your predefined categories by default ive used quite some supervised learning in the past and have had good experience with this type of learning therefore i will continue explaining this path feature engineering you have to come up with the features that you want to use for text classification a good approach is to use each possible word in the document as a feature a value of true represents if the word is present in the document false represents absence before doing this you need to do some preprocessing this can be done by using various features provided by the nltk library tokenization this will break your text up into a list of words you can use this module stopword removal this will remove common words out of the tokens words likes athe you can take a look at this stemming stemming will transform words to their stemform for example the words workingworkedworks will be transformed to work take a look at this now if you have preprocessed the data then generate a featureset for each word that exists in the documents there exist automatic methods and filters for this but im not sure how to do this in python classification there are multiple classifiers that you can use for this purpose i suggest to take a deeper look at the ones that exist and their benefitsyou can user the nltk classifier which supports multiclassification but to be honest i never tried that one before in the past ive used logistic regression and svm training testing you will use a part of your data for training and a part for validating if the trained model performs well i suggest you to use crossvalidation because you will have a small dataset you have to manually label the data which is cumbersome the benefit of crossvalidation is that you dont have to split your dataset in a training set and testing set instead it will run in multiple rounds and iterate through the data for a part training data and a part testing data resulting in all the data being used at least once in your training data predicting once your model is built and the outcome of the predictions on testdata is plausible you can use your model in the wild to predict the categories of the new facebook messagestweets tools the nltk library is great for preprocessing and natural language processing but i never used it before for classification ive heard a lot of great things about the scikit python library but to be fair honest i prefer to use weka which is a data mining tool written in java offering a great ui and which speeds up your task a lot from a different angle topic modelling in your question you state that you want to classify the dataset into five categories i would like to show you the idea of topic modelling it might not be useful in your scenario if you are really only targeting those categories thats why i leave this part at the end of my answer however if your goal is to categorise the tweetsfb messages into nonpredefined categories topic modelling is the way to go topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where you decide in advance the amount of topicscategories you want to discover this number can be high eg now the cool thing is that the algorithm will find topics that contain words that have something related it will also output for each document a distribution that indicates to which topics the document is related this way you can discover a lot more categories than your predefined ones now im not gonna go much deeper into this but just google it if you want more information in addition you could consider to use mallet which is an excellent tool for topic modelling

54378037,movie ratings prediction using tfidf,python scikitlearn tfidf textprocessing,you should fittransform once and then transform using existed cv and trained cv object change to the and this should fix your problem if you call fittransofrm again with additional data it probably contains another number of unique words and it will produce a vocabulary of another size then dimension of mnb trained with other data and other size of vaocabulary will be different thats what valueerror dimension mismatch edit just check xtestcv and xtraincv for both cases if you fittransform for xtrain and xtest it gives different shapes but if you replace the second fittransform fot transform they will be the same
47663248,ai model for arbitrary text prediction,tensorflow artificialintelligence textprocessing,a character rnn would be a good place to start with this if youre new to the field its definitely the best place to start because there are a lot of tutorials and examples to help you get off the ground and because we know they work read karpathys excellent blog paper on this you certainly can provide custom input during sampling once the network is trained you can sample in a number of different ways and in fact you have to provide at least the first character as custom input a typical sampling pattern would be to randomly select a first character as input to the first rnn sequence step then the rnn will produce a probability distribution over the alphabet which you can randomly sample the next character from for the nd character lets say you sampled from the rnns probability distribution then the randomly selected character becomes the input of the next rnn sequence step and so on with the following characters notice that there is nothing stopping you from seeding a sequence of multiple characters ignoring the rnns output at each step and then sampling the rnns output after some input sequence has completed thus achieving your goal of starting with a custom input sequence that then gets continued i expect that this approach will work quite well for you

41682860,does naive bayes classifier perform text annotation,textprocessing informationextraction,naive bayes is a form of classifier that makes a prediction about one variable for example a label for a document in a sequence tagging problem you are making predictions about a sequence of variables one for each token you can do this by treating each token as its own independent classification problem or you can use a model that makes predictions for the whole sequence jointly with the decision for one token affecting the decision for neighboring tokens the sequence equivalent for naive bayes is a hidden markov model an equivalent classifiersequencetagger pair is logistic regression and conditional random fields crfs mallet implements all of these as do many other systems

70461730,my naive bayes classifier works for my model but will not accept user input on my application,python classification sentimentanalysis naivebayes countvectorizer,so it seems to me that there are multiple issues here at play for one sdf pddataframejournalentry does not make sense you create the data frame from literal string journalentry not the actual contents of it i suggest you get rid of the dataframe in your entry function entirely as it is not a required input structure for sklearn objects secondly youre duplicating functionality with calling fittransform and then again transform in your entry function its sufficient to call fittransform as its doing two things it learns the dictionary it transforms to documentterm matrix thirdly you trained your model using a specific countvectorizer model this model will transform each document into vectors using the learned documentterm matrix which acquires a fixed size at the time you call fit or fittransform function then your naive bayes model is trained using this fixed sized vector hence it complains when it gets a different sized vector at inference time this is because youre reinitializing countvectorizer again at each entry call you need to save the countvectorizer as well if you want to preserve the feature size also id suggest making some check in your entry function that makes sure you get valid strings for your algorithm in the post request load both countvectorizer and the model vec pickleloadopenmycountvecpkl rb sentimentmodel pickleloadopenmysentimentmodel rb approutejournal methodsget post def entry if requestmethod post journals requestform entrydate journalsentrydate journalentry journalsjournalentry sdf vectransformjournalentryreshape sentiment sentimentmodelpredictsdf sdf vectransformjournalentryreshape assumes that journal entry is a single string and hence it needs reshaping for further processing

69558824,about lstm structure for classification in this case its sentiment analysis,python lstm sentimentanalysis,after you fed lstm layer with vectors which represented each words of each sentences of the dataset what does lstm layer do with them and what is the output the final output of the architecture you show up to the point it is fed into the softmax is a sentence embedding ie a single highdimensional floatingpoint vector that represents the sentence you showed the unrolled version but i find it useful to be simultaneously thinking of its real rolled up form too as far as this question goes it is doing the same thing as a simple rnn so make sure you understand that first there are a lot of articles and videos explaining it eg what does the forget gate do it tries to learn which are the more important words if being trained for sentiment analysis it will hopefully learn to give more weight to words that are emotive and less weight to the words carrying no sentiment you might also see it called a keep gate when the weight is high it keeps the word when the weight is low it forgets the word say you had a long sentence like this movie has some really funny characters and superb action scenes and was directed by tom smith produced by dick jones and began production in the problem here for an rnn doing sentiment analysis is that it maintains state one word at a time each step it loses a bit of what went before by the end it has all but forgotten the positive early words you really want it seen as really funny characters superb action scenes that is a much shorter sentence to learn and understand so this is what the forget gate in an lstm is trying to do for you spoiler alert it does not do it that well but it is distinctly better than not doing it at all why there are two lstm layers to allow more sophisticated understanding and better sentence embeddings it is the same as adding another layer in a fullyconnected neural network lstms dont scale very well beyond two layers however how the model know that sentences sentiment base on that vector exactly does that vector have some kind of features that make it positive or negative the answer to your second subquestion is maybe but not always in a humanreadable form what the very last layer of your architecture is doing is trying to learn what kind of sentiment each element of the vector indicates using a classic fullyconnected neural net eg say you use vectors of dimension and you want to classify into three classes angry happy sad your training data then has sentences like everything went smoothly today with a label of happy maybe that sentence has a high number in element of the vector the lstm produces maybe most of the happy sentences have a high value in that element but the angry and sad sentences show no pattern for it so it gives a high positive weight connecting element to the happy output and a zero weight connecting to each of angry and sad if your goal is improving your intuition it can be interesting to build models with just or dimensions and just a few training sentences and then deliberately overfit the model on your training data sometimes you get noise but sometimes you get lucky and can follow through how the vectors for each word interact to give a different pattern in the output and how the final layer combines them to give a prediction

68255234,how to tune sentiment analysis when one algorithm says positive and one negative,sentimentanalysis,in the general machine learning case this is what ensembles are all about taking the output of multiple models and making a decision so there is a huge amount of literature you can read there when you have two models the choices will come down to sum their confidences trust one more get a rd opinion as a tiebreaker make no decisionescalate to a human if the two models are binary classifiers then you cannot use the first idea which would say if model a says it is positive sentiment and model b says it is negative sentiment then the sum is so it is positive the second idea with only two binary classifier models makes your less trusted model pointless but it is useful if you have scores to work with extending the previous example if you trust model b twice as much ie because you trust model b more you allow its to override model as and decide it is negative

54148912,is it possible to pass more than one query in the twitter api for sentiment analysis in python,python pythonx twitter tweepy sentimentanalysis,so im not going to write out the entire code for you but you absolutely can do what youre looking for using twitters standard operators you can use these to build up a query string of your keywords to get what you want so say you wanted tweets that contained java ruby and python together youd make your query now say you wanted tweets containing any of those words you could use logical or eg of course now youve got to find a way to actually use these the apisearch method should work for that i believe you can still use this on its own but thats generally discouraged now theres the cursor this means you dont have to deal with the tweets being separated by pagination it does it all for you so the bit of your code that does the search will look something like so in the above tweepycursor is essentially getting a list of status objects each object is essentially all the information of a single tweet they contain things like a tweets text the time it was posted number of retweets etc therefore the tweet variable in the for loop is a single status object which you can extract the data you require from the items at the end gets you individual status objects as opposed to a page of them you can put a number in there to define how many tweets you want to return for more examples have a look here lots of different uses of the cursor there that should give you an idea of how it is used some other useful links tweepy cursor documentation short but itll give you the gist of the cursor tweepy method docs this gives you info on all the tweepy methods and lets you know the kind of searches you can perform hope that helps best of luck with the sentiment analysis
54069351,gcp sentiment analysis returns same score for different documents what am i doing wrong,python googlecloudplatform sentimentanalysis,yes there are some quotas in the usage of the natural language api the natural language api processes text into a series of tokens which roughly correspond to word boundaries attempting to process tokens in excess of the token quota which is by default tokens per query will not produce an error but any tokens over that quota will be ignored for the second question it is difficult for me to evaluate the results of the natural language api without having access to the documents maybe as they are too neutral you are getting the very similar results i have run some tests with large neutral texts and i got similar results just for clarification as stated in the natural language api documentation documentsentiment contains the overall sentiment of the document which consists of the following fields score of the sentiment ranges between negative and positive and corresponds to the overall emotional leaning of the text magnitude indicates the overall strength of emotion both positive and negative within the given text between and inf unlike score magnitude is not normalized each expression of emotion within the text both positive and negative contributes to the texts magnitude so longer text blocks may have greater magnitudes

46253404,using text sentiment as feature in machine learning model,machinelearning sentimentanalysis datascience textanalysis,of course you can convert text input single number with sentiment analysis then use this number as a feature in your machine learning model nothing wrong with this approach the question is what kind of information you want to extract from text data because sentiment analysis convert text input to a number between to and the number represents how positive or negative the text is for example you may want sentiment information of the customers comments about a restaurant to measure their satisfaction in this case it is fine to use sentiment analysis to preprocess text data but again sentiment analysis is only given an idea about how positive or negative text is you may want to cluster text data and sentiment information is not useful in this case since it does not provide any information about the similarity of texts thus other approaches such as wordvec or bagofwords will be used for the representation of text data in those tasks because those algorithms provide vector representation of the text instance of a single number in conclusion the approach depends on what kind of information you need to extract from data for your specific task
45904323,what is the proper way to deal with score dispersion in sentiment analysis on different topics in relation,sentimentanalysis,the short answer is both the algorithm and the input keywords as they are dependent on each other given the right input the dispersion would increse in any algorithm and given the wrong algorithm the same will happen for any input usually in this cases you should revise the algorithm as this is the case in most situations you can also read this in order to understand it better
45889395,how could i improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis of news headlines,python sentimentanalysis textblob vader,the basic difference is that most current tools work on a sentiment index of individual words for instance finding like or excellent anywhere in the text will signal a positive evaluation your examples depends more on some understanding of the phrases requiring minimal parsing thats a more detailed process requiring a deeper understanding of the language semantics one way you could attack this is to fill the lexicon with indexed phrases inserted as words as well as words then you preprocess the input to convert those phrases to whatever indication youve used in the lexicon for instance join those phrases with underscores and darkside is in your lexicon with a negative index im hopeful this gives you a nudge in a useful direction

45275166,is vader sentimentintensityanalyzer multilingual,python machinelearning sentimentanalysis vader,the short answer is no the readme file on the github page states if you have access to the internet the demo has an example of how vader can work with analyzing sentiment of texts in other languages nonenglish text sentences but if you take a look at what is actually done for this demonstration beginning at line in the current version of vadersentimentpy this is based entirely on using a machinetranslation web service to automatically translate the text into english as such the results are reliant not only upon the accuracy of the sentiment analysis tool but also upon the accuracy of whichever translation tool you use to create the english version of the input vader only performs sentiment analysis on english texts but that workaround automatic translation may be a viable option sentiment analysis is less sensitive to common machine translation problems than other usages but youll certainly still have to keep the limitations in mind if you choose to use that workaround to give an example the service used in the demo translates das internet funktioniert heute nicht ist eine strung bekannt to the internet was not working today is a disorder known which would be more accurately translated as the internet isnt working today is a disruption known its got the tense wrong in the first sentence and while there are several legitimate translations of strung in this context disorder is an awkward choice at best nevertheless while this makes it quite a bad translation in general the errors are unlikely to affect a sentiment analysis significantly

44306123,what information in document vectors makes sentiment prediction work,machinelearning sentimentanalysis gensim featureselection docvec,this is less a question about docvec than about machinelearning principles with highdimensional data your approach is collapsing dimensions to a single dimension the distance to your random point then youre hoping that single dimension can still be predictive and roughly all logisticregression can do with that singlevalued input is try to pick a thresholdnumber that when your distance is on one side of that threshold predicts a class and on the other side predicts notthatclass recasting that singlethresholddistance back to the original dimensional space its essentially trying to find a hypersphere around your random point that does a good job collecting all of a single class either inside or outside its volume what are the odds your randomlyplaced centerpoint plus one adjustable radius can do that well in a complex highdimensional space my hunch is not a lot and your results no better than random guessing seems to suggest the same the logisticregression with access to the full dimensions finds a discriminatingfrontier for assigning the class thats described by coefficients and one interceptvalue and all of those values free parameters can be adjusted to improve its classification performance in comparison your alternative logisticregression with access to only the one distancefromarandompoint dimension can pick just one coefficient for the distance and an interceptbias its got th as much information to work with and only free parameters to adjust as an analogy consider a much simpler space the surface of the earth pick a random point like say the south pole if i then tell you that you are in an unknown place miles from the south pole can you answer whether you are more likely in the usa or china hardly both of those classes of location have lots of instances miles from the south pole only in the extremes will the distance tell you for sure which class country youre in because there are parts of the usas alaska and hawaii further north and south than parts of china but even there you cant manage well with just a single threshold youd need a rule which says less than x or greater than y in usa otherwise unknown the dimensional space of docvec vectors or other rich data sources will often only be sensibly divided by far more complicated rules and our intuitions about distances and volumes based on or dimensional spaces will often lead us astray in high dimensions still the earth analogy does suggest a way forward there are some reference points on the globe that will work way better when you know the distance to them at deciding if youre in the usa or china in particular a point at the center of the us or at the center of china would work really well similarly you may get somewhat better classification accuracy if rather than a random fixvec you pick either a any point for which a class is already known or b some average of all known points of one class in either case your fixvec is then likely to be in a neighborhood of similar examples rather than some random spot that has no more essential relationship to your classes than the south pole has to northernhemisphere temperatezone countries also alternatively picking n multiple random points and then feeding the n distances to your regression will preserve more of the informationshape of the original docvec data and thus give the classifier a better chance of finding a useful separatingthreshold two would likely do better than your one distance and might approach or surpass the original dimensions finally some comment about the docvec aspect docvec optimizes vectors that are somewhatgood within their constrained model at predicting the words of a text positivesentiment words tend to occur together as do negativesentiment words and so the trained docvectors tend to arrange themselves in similar positions when they need to predict similarmeaningwords so there are likely to be neighborhoods of the docvector space that correlate well with predominantly positivesentiment or negativesentiment words and thus positive or negative sentiments these wont necessarily be two giant neighborhoods positive and negative separated by a simple boundary or even a small number of neighborhoods matching our ideas of d solid volumes and many subtleties of communication such as sarcasm referencing a notheld opinion to critique it spending more time on negative aspects but ultimately concluding positive etc mean incursions of alternatesentiment words into texts a fullylanguagecomprehending human agent could understand these to conclude the true sentiment while these wordoccurrence based methods will still be confused but with an adequate model and the right number of free parameters a classifier might capture some generalizable insight about the highdimensional space in that case you can achieve reasonablygood predictions using the docvec dimensions as youve seen with the results on the full dimensional vectors

42414917,what is the relationship between machine learning and sentiment analysis,machinelearning socialnetworking sentimentanalysis,there has been research working on the automatic detection of user latent variables including age and gender on social media data these studies have taken into account a variety of features and evaluated their effectiveness for instance the content of ones social media post can say a lot about their age and gender for example studies have shown that if someone uses the word buddy the user is more likely to be a young male so the answer to your question is yes you can use machine learning techniques to detect age and gender on social media however choosing an effective set of features depends on the context you want to study and the platform you want to focus on and it requires some experimentation use of sentiment as a feature might be useful in one context and might not be of help in another i refer you to the following articles that have studied this topic before this one analyzes a set of contentbased and stylistic feature including sentiment this paper looks at tokenbased and characterbased methods this one looks at ones social neighborhood to predict hisher characteristics

37883474,need clarification on the calculation of average polarity score returned by sentiment function of sentimentrtrinker,r sentimentanalysis sentimentr,here is an idea maybe the first function is taking the averages from the individual sentences and the second one is taking the average from the ave sentiment which is already an average so the average of averages is not always equal to the average of the individual elements
37639516,does the ratio of two classes matter in classification problems,machinelearning sentimentanalysis,yes yes it can there are two things to consider of is thus you will try to model data distribution of your class based on just samples this might be orders of magnitude to small for neural network consequently you might need x more data to have a representative sample of your data while you can easily reduce the majority class through subsampling without the big risk of destroing the structure there is no way to get more structure from less points you can replicate points add noise etc but this does not add structure this just adds assumptions class imbalance can also lead to convergence to naive solutions like always false which has accuracy here you can simply play around with the cost function to make it more robust to imbalance in particular train splits suggested by purew is nothing else like black box method of trying to change the loss function so it has bigger weight on minority class when you have access to your classifier loss like in nn you should not due this but instead change the cost function and still keep all the data

33536182,testing the keras sentiment classification with modelpredict,python sentimentanalysis lstm keras,so what you basically need to do is as follows tokenize sequnces convert the string into words features for example hello my name is georgio to hello my name is georgio next you want to remove stop words check google for what stop words are this stage is optional it may lead to faulty results but i think it worth a try stem your words features that way youll reduce the number of features which will lead to a faster run again thats optional and might lead to some failures for example if you stem the word parking you get park which has a different meaning next thing is to create a dictionary check google for that each word gets a unique number and from this point we will use this number only computers understand numbers only so we need to talk in their language well take the dictionary from stage and replace each word in our corpus with its matching number now we need to split our data set to two groups training and testing sets one training will train our nn model and the second testing will help us to figure out how good is our nn you can use keras cross validation function next thing is defining whats the max number of features our nn can get as an input keras call this parameter maxlen but you dont really have to do this manually keras can do that automatically just by searching for the longest sentence you have in your corpus next lets say that keras found out that the longest sentence in your corpus has words features and one of your sentences is the example in the first stage which its length is if well remove stop words itll be shorter in such case well need to add zeros zeros actually this is called pad sequence we do that so every input sequence will be in the same length

20017419,tweet classification how to identify type of conversation,twitter classification bayesian tweets sentimentanalysis,in sentiment analysis and opinion mining there are some chapters on spam detection in online reviews i imagine some of those techniques would apply very well for learning features beyond just the words and punctuation and sentence patterns the number of retweets might be useful questions dont get retweeted as much as news for instance also what people write with the retweet this is great is more likely to be news whereas anyone know is likely to be a question whereas what do you think of this or id never thought of this might introduce a tip or suggestion
18513413,understanding this application of a naive bayes classifier,bayesian sentimentanalysis,first of all the formula isnt quite right you need to divide that by pw but you hint that this is taken care of later when it says that they do a few sums so we can move on to your main question traditionally when doing naive bayes on text classification you only look at the existence of words not their counts of course you need the counts to estimate pword class at train time but at test time pmusic terrorism typically means the probability that the word music is present at least once in a terrorism document it looks like what the implementation you are dealing with is doing is its trying to take into account poccurrences of kill terrorism which is different from pat least occurrence of kill terrorism so why do they end up raising probabilities to powers it looks like their reasoning is that pkill terrorism which they estimated at train time represents the probability of an arbitrary word in a terrorism document to be kill so by simplifying assumption the probability of a second arbitrary word in a terrorism document to be kill is also pkill terrorism this leaves a slight problem for the case that a word does not occur in a document with this scheme the corresponding probability is raised to the th power in other words it goes away in other words it is approximating that poccurrences of music terrorism it should be clear that in general this is strictly speaking false since it would imply that poccurrences of music terrorism but for real world examples where you have long documents and thousands or tens of thousands of words most words dont occur in most documents so instead of bothering with accurately calculating all those probabilities which would be computationally expensive they are basically swept under the rug because for the vast majority of cases it wouldnt change the classification outcome anyway also note that on top of it being computationally intensive it is numerically unstable because if you are multiplying thousands or tens of thousands of numbers less than together you will underflow and it will spit out if you do it in log space you are still adding tens of thousands of numbers together which would have to be handled delicately from a numerical stability point of view so the raising it to a power scheme inherently removes unnecessary fluff decreasing computational intensity increasing numerical stability and still yields nearly identical results i hope the nsa doesnt think im a terrorist for having used the word terrorism so much in this answer s

14924772,sentiment analysis,sentimentanalysis,well there are several methods i would start with checking capital letter usually when referring to a name first letter is capitalized before doing sentiment analysis i would use some partofspeech and named entity recognition to tag the relevant words stanford corenlp is a good text analysis project to start with it will teach you the basic concepts example from corenlp you can see how the tags can help you and check out more info
14486665,use sentiment dictionary value as features in svm,machinelearning classification svm informationretrieval sentimentanalysis,just some suggestions construct a vocabulary this vocabulary serves as a dictionary you will not include any word that does not present in the dictionary into your feature vector suppose your dictionary contains words prepare the sentiment strength for each word in the vocabulary of course you can setup some default for those words that you have no idea about their sentiment strength construct feature vector for each text you want to do classification for any given text eg construct a feature vector with dimensions each dimension corresponds to its tfidf score or just the number of occurrences of a word in the dictionary suppose in your dictionary you have and you dont have entries for this or is then you will end up with a vector with elements i am using the number of occurrences instead of tfidf in my following example feel free to try tfidf in a similar way all elements are zeros except the two elements that correspond to book and good plug in your sentiment strength you get multiplying the strength value with the number of occurrences will probably increase or decrease the value of the corresponding element this is fine because you do want to boost or weaken the contribution of the component by its sentiment strength training the svm when supplying each feature vector with a target value or class label you can train your svm now hope they help

5741135,question on sentiment analysis,python twitter machinelearning sentimentanalysis,while awaiting for answers from researchers in ai field i will give you some clues on what you can do quickly even though this topic requires knowledge from natural language processing machine learning and even psychology you dont have to start from scratch unless youre desperate or have no trust in the quality of research going on in the field one possible approach to sentiment analysis would be to treat it as a supervised learning problem where you have some small training corpus that includes human made annotations later about that and a testing corpus on which you test how well you approachsystem is performing for training you will need some classifiers like svm hmm or some others but keep it simple i would start from binary classification good bad you could do the same for a continuous spectrum of opinion ranges from positive to negative that is to get a ranking like google where the most valuable results come on top for a start check libsvm classifier it is capable of doing both classification good bad and regression ranking the quality of annotations will have a massive influence on the results you get but where to get it from i found one project about sentiment analysis that deals with restaurants there is both data and code so you can see how they extracted features from natural language and which features scored high in the classification or regression the corpus consists of opinions of customers about restaurants they recently visited and gave some feedback about the food service or atmosphere the connection about their opinions and numerical world is expressed in terms of numbers of stars they gave to the restaurant you have natural language on one site and restaurants rate on another looking at this example you can devise your own approach for the problem stated take a look at nltk as well with nltk you can do part of speech tagging and with some luck get names as well having done that you can add a feature to your classifier that will assign a score to a name if within n words skip ngram there are words expressing opinions look at the restaurant corpus or use weights you already have but its best to rely on a classfier to learn weights thats his job

domain st way we can use it as part of our custom model training with the base trainable nd or nottrainable rd st approach how to finetune bert for text classification demonstrated the st approach of further pretraining and pointed out the learning rate is the key to avoid catastrophic forgetting where the pretrained knowledge is erased during learning of new knowledge we find that a lower learning rate such as e is necessary to make bert overcome the catastrophic forgetting problem with an aggressive learn rate of e the training set fails to converge probably this is the reason why the bert paper used e e e and e for finetuning we use a batch size of and finetune for epochs over the data for all glue tasks for each task we selected the best finetuning learning rate among e e e and e on the dev set note that the base model pretraining itself used higher learning rate bertbaseuncased pretraining the model was trained on cloud tpus in pod configuration tpu chips total for one million steps with a batch size of the sequence length was limited to tokens for of the steps and for the remaining the optimizer used is adam with a learning rate of e and a weight decay of learning rate warmup for steps and linear decay of the learning rate after will describe the st way as part of the rd approach below fyi tfdistilbertmodel is the bare base model with the name distilbert nd approach huggingface takes the nd approach as in finetuning with native pytorchtensorflow where tfdistilbertforsequenceclassification has added the custom classification layer classifier on top of the base distilbert model being trainable the small learning rate requirement will apply as well to avoid the catastrophic forgetting implementation of the nd approach rd approach basics please note that the images are taken from a visual guide to using bert for the first time and modified tokenizer tokenizer generates the instance of batchencoding which can be used like a python dictionary and the input to the bert model batchencoding holds the output of the encodeplus and batchencode methods tokens attentionmasks etc this class is derived from a python dictionary and can be used as a dictionary in addition this class exposes utility methods to map from wordcharacter space to token space parameters data dict dictionary of listsarraystensors returned by the encodebatchencode methods inputids attentionmask etc the data attribute of the class is the tokens generated which has inputids and attentionmask elements inputids inputids the input ids are often the only required parameters to be passed to the model as input they are token indices numerical representations of tokens building the sequences that will be used as input by the model attentionmask attention mask this argument indicates to the model which tokens should be attended to and which should not if the attentionmask is the token id is ignored for instance if a sequence is padded to adjust the sequence length the padded words should be ignored hence their attentionmask are special tokens berttokenizer addes special tokens enclosing a sequence with cls and sep cls represents classification and sep separates sequences for question answer or paraphrase tasks sep separates the two sentences to compare berttokenizer clstoken str optional defaults to clsthe classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification classification of the whole sequence instead of pertoken classification it is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens septoken str optional defaults to septhe separator token which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences eg two sequences for sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering it is also used as the last token of a sequence built with special tokens a visual guide to using bert for the first time show the tokenization cls the embedding vector for cls in the output from the base model final layer represents the classification that has been learned by the base model hence feed the embedding vector of cls token into the classification layer added on top of the base model bert pretraining of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding the first token of every sequence is always a special classification token cls the final hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification tasks sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence we differentiate the sentences in two ways first we separate them with a special token sep second we add a learned embedding to every token indicating whether it belongs to sentence a or sentence b the model structure will be illustrated as below vector size in the model distilbertbaseuncased each token is embedded into a vector of size the shape of the output from the base model is batchsize maxsequencelength embeddingvectorsize this accords with the bert paper about

60610280,bertforsequenceclassification vs bertformultiplechoice for sentence multiclass classification,python machinelearning pytorch bertlanguagemodel huggingfacetransformers,the answer to this lies in the admittedly very brief description of what the tasks are about bertformultiplechoice eg for rocstoriesswag tasks when looking at the paper for swag it seems that the task is actually learning to choose from varying options this is in contrast to your classical classification task in which the choices ie classes do not vary across your samples which is exactly what bertforsequenceclassification is for both variants can in fact be for an arbitrary number of classes in the case of bertforsequenceclassification respectively choices for bertformultiplechoice via changing the labels parameter in the config but since it seems like you are dealing with a case of classical classification i suggest using the bertforsequenceclassification model shortly addressing the missing softmax in bertforsequenceclassification since classification tasks can compute loss across classes indipendent of the sample unlike multiple choice where your distribution is changing this allows you to use crossentropy loss which factors in softmax in the backpropagation step for increased numerical stability

66264264,lstm prediction restriction,deeplearning neuralnetwork lstm,while this is technically possible you would have to write your own lstm implementation or extend the existing one however it doesnt seem like a good approach towards this problem if you find yourself in the situation where youre feeding data to the network that you dont want it to process you should just preprocess your input to only hold relevant data show the network what you want it to see if you want the network to output specific behavior in certain situations you can encode that behavior by modifying the labels to reflect this behavior finally note that your use case suggests that you should be working with categorical labels and softmax output ie framing this as a classification instead of a regression problem
66048406,pytorch predicting future values with lstm,machinelearning deeplearning timeseries pytorch lstm,ive finally found a way to forecast values based on predicted values from the earlier observations as expected the predictions were rather accurate in the shortterm slightly becoming worse in the long term it is not so surprising that the future predictions digress over time as they no longer depend on the actual values reflecting on my results and the discussions i had on the topic here are my takeaways in reallife cases the real values can be retrieved and fed into the model at each step of the prediction be it weekly daily or hourly so that the next step can be predicted with the actual values from the previous step so testing the performance based on the actual values from the test set may somewhat reflect the real performance of the model that is maintained regularly however for predicting future values in the long term forecasting if you will you need to make either multiple onestep predictions or multistep predictions that span over the time period you wish to forecast making multiple onestep predictions based on the values predicted the model yields plausible results in the short term as the forecasting period increases the predictions become less accurate and therefore less fit for the purpose of forecasting to make multiple onestep predictions and update the input after each prediction we have to work our way through the dataset one by one as if we are going through a forloop over the test set not surprisingly this makes us lose all the computational advantages that matrix operations and minibatch training provide us an alternative could be predicting sequences of values instead of predicting the next value only say using rnns with multidimensional output with manytomany or seqtoseq structure they are likely to be more difficult to train and less flexible to make predictions for different time periods an encoderdecoder structure may prove useful for solving this though i have not implemented it by myself you can find the code for my function that forecasts the next nsteps based on the last row of the dataset x timelag features and y target value to iterate over each row in my dataset i would set batchsize to and nfeatures to the number of lagged observations the following line shifts values in the second dimension of the tensor by one so that a tensor x x x xn becomes xn x x xn x torchrollx shifts dims and the line below selects the first element from the last dimension of the d tensor and sets that item to the predicted value stored in the numpy ndarray yhat xn then the new input tensor becomes xn x x xn x yhatitem recently ive decided to put together the things i had learned and the things i would have liked to know earlier if youd like to have a look you can find the links down below i hope youll find it useful feel free to comment or reach out to me if you agree or disagree with any of the remarks i made above building rnn lstm and gru for time series using pytorch predicting future values with rnn lstm and gru usingpytorch
65818241,lstmbased architecture for eeg signal classification basedon channel lstm,python keras classification lstm channel,first you have a problem in your implementation of encoder using common lstm the lstm layer of keras take inputs with shape batch timesteps channel by default so if you set your inputshape then the model will read as timesteps and channel which is opposite of what you intend to because first layer of encoder using common lstm described as at each time step t the first layer takes the input s tin this sense common means that all eeg channels are initially fed into the same lstm layer so the correct implementation of encoder using common lstm would be which outputs ps you could summarize your original implementation and you will see the total params is way bigger second because encoder using channel lstm and common lstm described as the first encoding layer consists of several lstms each connected to only one input channel for example the first lstm processes input datas the second lstm processess and so on in this way the output of each channel lstmis a summary of a single channels data the second encoding layer then performs interchannel analysis by receiving as input the concatenated output vectors of all channel lstms as above the output of the deepest lstm at the last time step is used as the encoders output vector since each lstm in the first layer only deal with one channel so we need the number of lstm equal to number of channel in the first layer following code show you how to build one encoder using channel lstm and common lstm outputs now because the model expect inputs with shape channel batch timesteps so we have to reorder the axis of dataset before feed into model following example code show you how to reorder the axis from batch timesteps channel to channel batch timesteps outputs

64953102,how can i use an lstm to classify a series of vectors into two categories in pytorch,machinelearning pytorch classification lstm,you should follow pytorch documentation especially inputs and outputs part always this is how the classifier should look like points to consider always use superinit as it registers modules in your neural networks allows for hooks etc use batchfirsttrue so you can pass inputs of shape batch timesteps nfeatures no need to inithidden with zeros it is the default value if left uninitialized no need to pass selfhidden each time to lstm moreover you should not do that it means that elements from each batch of data are somehow next steps while batch elements should be disjoint and you probably do not need that hn returns last hidden cell from last timestep exactly of shape numlayers numdirections batch hiddensize in our case numlayers and numdirections is so we get batch hiddensize tensor as output reshape to batch hiddensize so it can be passed through linear layer return logits without activation only one if it is a binary case use torchnnbcewithlogitsloss as loss for binary case and torchnncrossentropyloss for multiclass case also sigmoid is proper activation for binary case while softmax or logsoftmax is appropriate for multiclass for binary only one output is needed any value below if returning unnormalized probabilities as in this case is considered negative anything above positive

64793522,longer lstm prediction,python machinelearning pytorch lstm,right now you are running your lstm forward for timesteps and returning the hidden state that resulted at each timestep this kind of approach is commonly used when you know you need one output for every input eg in sequence labeling problems eg tagging each word in a sentence with its part of speech if you want to encode a variable length sequence then decode a sequence of arbitrary possibly different length eg for machine translation you need to look up sequencetosequence seqseq modeling more generally this is a bit more involved and involves two lstms one for encoding the input sequence the other for decoding the output sequence see encoderrnn and decoderrnn implementations in the pytorch tutorial linked above the basic idea is to take eg the final state of the lstm after consuming the input sentence then use that state to initialize a separate lstm decoder from which you sample autoregressively in other words you generate a new token feed the token back into the decoder then continue either for an arbitrary number of steps that you specify or until the lstm samples an end of sentence token if youve trained the lstm to predict the end of sampled sequences

62241417,how to improve lstm model predictions and accuracy,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,the problem is with your input youve padded your input sequences with zeros but have not provided this information to your model so your model doesnt ignore the zeros which is the reason its not learning at all to resolve this change your embedding layer as follows this will enable your model to ignore the zero padding and learn training with this i got a training accuracy of in just epochs though validation accuracy wasnt that good aroung which is expected as your training data contains only examples more about embedding layer since your dataset is small the model tends to overfit on training data quite easily which gives lower validation accuracy to mitigate this to some extent you can try using pretrained word embeddings like wordvec or glove instead of training your own embedding layer also try some text data augmentation methods like creating artificial data using templates or replacing words in training data with their synonyms you can also experiment with different types of layers like replacing gru with another lstm but in my opinion that may not help much here and should be considered after trying out pretrained embeddings and data augmentation

61808538,understanding dense layer in lstm architecture labels logits,machinelearning deeplearning lstm recurrentneuralnetwork,the short answer is that the keras loss function sparsecategoricalcrossentropy does everything you need at each timestep of the lstm model the top dense layer and softmax function inside that loss function together generate a probability distribution over the models vocabulary which in this case are musical notes suppose the vocabulary comprises the notes a b c d then one possible probability distribution generated is meaning that the model is putting a lot of probability on note b index like so suppose the true note should be c which is represented by the number since it is at index in the distribution array with indexing starting at to measure the difference between the predicted distribution and the true value distributions use the sparsecategoricalcrossentropy function to produce a floatingpoint number representing the loss more information can be found on this tensorflow documentation page on that page they have the example ytrue ypred loss tfkeraslossessparsecategoricalcrossentropyytrue ypred you can see in that example there is a batch of two instances for the first instance the true label is and the predicted distribution is and for the second instance the true label is while the predicted distribution is this function is used in your jupyter notebook in section to train our model on this classification task we can use a form of the crossentropy loss negative log likelihood loss specifically we will use the sparsecategoricalcrossentropy loss as it utilizes integer targets for categorical classification tasks we will want to compute the loss using the true targets the labels and the predicted targets the logits so to answer your questions directly it is my understanding that in this notebook in computeloss in any given batch we are comparing expected labels which are the notes themselves to the logits ie predictions from the dense layer yes your understanding is correct however arent these predictions supposed to be a probability distribution yes they are when are we actually selecting the label that we are predicting against it is done inside the sparsecategoricalcrossentropy function if your distribution is then that implicitly means that the function is predicting probability for index probability for index and probability for index a little more clarification on my question if the shape of our labels is batchsize of time steps and the shape of our logits is batchsize of time steps vocabsize at what point in the computeloss function are we actually selecting a label for each time step its inside that function

61676303,why does my multivariate lstm keeps predicting zeroes,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,a batch size of means your model weights are being adjusted based on observation rather than optimizing for a handful of observations common batch sizes are between and but can be adjusted depending on the model lstm models also require thousands of observations so get more training data if possible architectures can also vary so its best to try a number of different approaches and see what works best you can find more info here

61640963,prediction of next term in a sequence of multplication of using lstm,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,so i finally figured out the solution problem in above approach is that the mean and std of my train and test data were very different in other words i was training model with data of range and my test set was of range now the mean and standard deviation which i obtained from training data was vastly different than test data also std deviation in the above case is around of training data its very difficult for any model to predict accurately when trained with data having such high standard deviation the solution is that instead of directly feeding data into the model feed the difference of consecutive elements example instead of feeding the data p feed the data q where q is obtained by qi pi pi so now if we feed the model with data q ofc model will predict as model has only seen input of which we can just add to the last actual value and obtain the result so basic problem with the model is high standard deviation of training data and unseen values in test and the solution is to feed the difference of values but another question can be how do we do it if we want to predict next element of x ie exponential of in this case again model will possibly learn trend given data of type q but still model wont be very accurate as at some point itll again have values that have a very high mean and std lastly i read somewhere lstm isnt meant for extrapolating data from an embedding space model hasnt been exposed to there are other models for extrapolating data but its not lstm

61213493,pytorch lstm for multiclass classification typeerror not supported between instances of example and example,python pytorch lstm multiclassclassification,the bucketiterator sorts the data to make batches with examples of similar length to avoid having too much padding for that it needs to know what the sorting criterion is which should be the text length since it is not fixed to a specific data layout you can freely choose which field it should use but that also means you must provide that information to sortkey in your case there are two possible fields text and wagelabel and you want to sort it based on the length of the text trainiterator validiterator testiterator databucketiteratorsplits traindata validdata testtorch batchsize batchsize sortwithinbatch true sortkey lambda x lenxtext device device you might be wondering why it worked in the tutorial but doesnt in your example the reason is that if sortkey is not specified it defers it to the underlying dataset in the tutorial they used the imdb dataset which defines the sortkey to be xtext your custom dataset did not define that so you need to specify it manually

61055924,how to restrict the sequence prediction in an lstm model to match a specific pattern,machinelearning lstm reinforcementlearning generativeadversarialnetwork fst,if you are happy with your approach the easiest way might be if youd be able to train your lstm on the reversed sequences as to train it to give the weight of the previous word rather than the next one in such a case you can use the method you already employ except that the first subset of words would be satisfying the last vowel constraint i dont believe that this is guaranteed to produce the best result now if that reversal is not possible or if after reading my answer further you find that this doesnt find the best solution then i suggest using a pathfinding algorithm similar to reinforcement learning but not statistical as the weights computed by the trained lstm are deterministic what you currently use is essentially a depth first greedy search which depending on the lstm output might be even optimal say if lstm is giving you a guaranteed monotonous increase in the sum which doesnt vary much between the acceptable consequent words as the difference between n and n sequence is much larger than the difference between the different options of the nth word in the general case when there is no clear heuristic to help you you will have to perform an exhaustive search if you can come up with an admissible heuristic you can use a instead of dijkstras algorithm in the first option below and it will do the faster the better you heuristic is i suppose it is clear but just in case your graph connectivity is defined by your constraint sequence the initial node length sequence with no words is connected with any word in your data frame that matches the beginning of your constraint sequence so you do not have the graph as a data structure just its the compressed description as this constraint edit as per request in the comment here are additional details here are a couple of options though apply dijkstras algorithm multiple times dijkstras search finds the shortest path between known nodes while in your case we only have the initial node length sequence with no words and the final words are unknown find all acceptable last words those that satisfy both the pattern and vowel constraints apply dijkstras search for each one of those finding the largest word sequence weight sum for each of them dijkstras algorithm is tailored to the searching of the shortest path so to apply it directly you will have to negate the weights on each step and pick the smallest one of those that havent been visited yet after finding all solutions sentences that end with one of those last words that you identified initially select the smallest solution this is going to be exactly the largest weight sum among all solutions modify your existing depthfirst search to do an exhaustive search perform the search operation as you described in op and find a solution if the last step gives one if the last word with a correct vowel is available at all record the weight rollback one step to the previous word and pick the secondbest option among previous words you might be able to discard all the words of the same length on the previous step if there was no solution at all if there was a solution it depends on whether your lstm provides different weights depending on the previous word likely it does and in that case you have to perform that operation for all the words in the previous step when you run out of the words on the previous step move one step up and restart down from there you keep the current winner all the time as well as the list of unvisited nodes on every step and perform exhaustive search eventually you will find the best solution

60324996,multi class sparsecategoricalcrossentropy truepositives metric incompatible shapes vs,tensorflow machinelearning keras deeplearning lstm,but if you do want to know how to do it for multiclass problems then we need to create custom metrics first i must say that i believe it doesnt make much sense to have these metrics in a categorical problem only one correct class among many softmax categoricalcrossentropy such problem is not binary so there isnt really a positive and a negative but one correct among many if you look at it as individual classes and treat each one as a binary class youd get something like every time the model gets a class right it means tp tn notice how many true negatives are there because there are more than just two outcomes every time the model gets a class wrong it means fp fn tn if you add up these numbers they simply dont make much sense perhaps im missing some special method for calculating these for a categorical problem and yet you can use everything that is below for this too knowing the above now on the other hand you can get good metrics for multiple binary classes where each class is independent from the others and more than one class can be correct sigmoid binarycrossentropy in this case you can follow two approaches get the metrics per class average the metrics of all classes somehow you can see some types of averages here in the sklearn documentation metrics per class these correspond to the binary average mode in the sklearn documentation alternative have each class as an individual model output in compile set all these metrics for each of the outputs tensorflow will see each output individually and calculate everything without problems alternative this should be done as an individual metric for each class so we can create a wrapper for this considering the class index ill make some examples notice that none of them can be sparse because more than one class can be correct so in this case the ground true data will have shape samples classes just like the predicted pred values for every metric you create a wrapper like this a wrapper like this can be used like here now each of the following metrics should have their own wrapper which i did not write here to avoid unnecessary repetition explanation about auc important precision recall and auc will not be exact values as keras calculates metrics batchwise and then averages the results of each batch averaged metrics these probably only make sense with precision and recall so im doing it for these two there is no need for wrappers here or for individual outputs the true and pred data are like in the previous examples with shape samples classes here we use the same calculations but now we keep all classes together and decide how to average them you can do the same for recallmicro and recallmacro but using tpfn instead of tpfp

59282996,zero predictions despite masking support for zeropadded mini batch lstm training in keras,python keras deeplearning lstm minibatch,first problem your x data after reshaping is not what you expected if you look at the first sample after reshaping it is so actually no timestep is masked because masking layer only mask timesteps where all features are so the above timesteps are not masked because none of them are completely for the masking layer to ensure you have the mask propogated to the output layer successfully you can do so you can see that the final layer also has the outputmask which means the masks are successfully propogated you seem to have a misunderstanding of how masking works in keras what it actually does is it will generate a mask which is a boolean array the shape of the mask is none timesteps since in your model definition the timestep dimension is always kept the same so the mask will be propogated to the end without any changes then when keras calculate loss and of course when it calculate gradients the timesteps which has a mask value false will be ignored the masking layer doesnt change the output value and of course your model will still predict class what it only does is to produce a boolean array indicating which timestep should be skipped and pass it to the end if all the layers accept the mask so what you can do is change one line of your model definition as follows and make your ylabels shifted by which means your current classes since the loss of these timesteps will be ignored not contributing to the training of the model so whether it is or doesnt matter you can also see my answer here for understanding how the loss are calculated with without masking

56512214,why does lstm model produce different predictions across multiple model runs,python timeseries lstm,many methods like this are initialized with random weights for the coefficients then they search for a good local minimum to some sort of loss function this means they will hopefully find just one of the many nearly optimal solutions but are unlikely to find the single very best solution nor to even find the same solution repeatedly due to this your results are typical so long as your predictions are only slightly different this is more of a general machine learning question rather than being specific to python but i hope this helps

56208659,whats the output for keras categoricalaccuracy metrics,machinelearning keras lstm kerasmetrics,the accuracy metric is actually a placeholder and keras chooses the appropriate accuracy metric for you between binaryaccuracy if you use binarycrossentropy loss and categoricalaccuracy if you use categoricalcrossentropy loss so in this specific case both metrics accuracy and categoricalaccuracy are literally the same and modelevaluate return loss and accuracy

54574813,loss function for class imbalanced multiclass classifier in keras,python keras lstm,first of all you have k samples start with something smaller like samples and multiple epochs and see whether your model overfits to this smaller training dataset if it cant you either have an error in your code or the model is not capable to model the dependencies i would go with the second case seriously start with this one and remember about representing all of your classes in this small dataset secondly hidden size of lstm may be too small you have features for each sequence and sequences have length of while your hidden is only and you apply dropout to top it off and regularize the network even further furthermore you may want to add some dense outputs units instead of merely returning a linear layer of size x for each timestamp last but not least you may want to upsample the underrepresented data class would have to be repeated say times or maybe class something around times and your one around times so the network is trained on them oh and use crossvalidation for your hyperparameters like the hidden size number of dense units etc plus i dont know for how many epochs youve been training this network what is your test dataset it is entirely possible it only constitutes of the first class if you havent done stratification i think this will get you started hit me up with any doubts in the comments edit when it comes to metrics you may want to check something different than mere accuracy maybe f score and your loss monitoring accuracy to see how it performs there are other available choices for inspiration you can check sklearns documentation as they provide quite a few options
54457016,manytomany classification with keras lstm,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,there can be many approaches to this i am specifying which can be good fit to your problem if you want to stack two lstm layer then returnseq can help to learn for another lstm layer as shown in following example another option is that you can use the complete return sequence as the features for the next layer in that case make a simple dense layer whose input will be batch seqlenlstmoutputdims note these features can be useful for classification task but mostly we used stacked lstm layer and use its output without complete sequence as features for the classification layer this answer may be helpful to understand another approaches for lstm architecture for different purpose
54368686,lstm having a systematic offset between predictions and ground truth,python tensorflow keras lstm recurrentneuralnetwork,it looks like your model is overfitting and is simply always returning the value from the last timestep as a prediction your dataset is probably too small to have a model with this amount of parameters converge youll need to resort to techniques that combat overfitting agressive dropout adding more data or try simpler less overparameterized methods this phenomenon lstms returning a shifted version of the input has been a recurring theme in many stackoverflow questions the answers there might contain some useful information lstm sequence prediction in keras just outputs last step in the input lstm model just repeats the past in forecasting time series lstm nn produces shifted forecast low quality result keras network producing inverse predictions stock price predictions of keras multilayer lstm model converge to a constant value keras lstm predicted timeseries squashed and shifted lstm time series shifted predictions on stock market close price interesting results from lstm rnn lagged results for train and validation data finally be aware that depending on the nature of your dataset there simply might be no pattern to be discovered in your data at all you see this a lot with people trying to predict the stock market with lstms there is a question on stackoverflow on how to predict the lottery numbers
54241131,how to structure and size ylabels for multivariate sequence prediction using keras lstms,python keras deeplearning lstm recurrentneuralnetwork,okay so if i understand you properly correct me if im wrong you would like to predict next features based on the current ones when it comes to categorical variables you are on point your dense layer should output n vector containing probability of each class while we are at it if you by any chance use pandasgetdummies remember to specify argument dropfirsttrue similiar approach should be employed whatever you are using for onehot encoding except those n output vector for each sample it should output one more number for numerical value remember to output logits no activation dont use softmax at the end like you currently do afterwards network output should be separated into n part your categorical feature and passed to loss function able to handle logits eg in tensorflow it is tfnnsoftmaxcrossentropywithlogitsv which applies numerically stable softmax for you now your nth element of network output should be passed to different loss probably mean squared error based on loss value of those two losses you could take a mean of both to obtain one loss value you backpropagate through the network and it might do just fine unfortunately im not skilled enough in keras in order to help you with the code but i think you will figure it out yourself while were at it i would like to suggest pytorch for more custom neural networks i think yours fits this description though its definitely doable in keras as well your choice additional maybe helpful thought you may check teacher forcing for your kind of task more on the topic and theory behind it can be found in the outstanding deep learning book and code example though in pytorch once again can be found in their docs here btw interesting idea mind if i use it in connection with my current research trajectory with kudos going to you of course comment on this answer if so we can talk it out in chat
53979199,tensorflow keras returning multiple predictions while expecting one,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,when you write it is if you are giving the model three input samples and therefore in return you would get three outputs one for each input sample instead if by you really mean one input sample then you wrap it in two lists the reason the most outer list corresponds to the list of all the input data for all the input layers of the model which is one here the second list corresponds to the data for the first and only input layer and the third list corresponds the one input sample thats the case with list inputs since multiinput and multioutput keras models should take a list of input arrays as input one better way is to use a numpy array instead nparray has a shape of which means one sample of length
53977695,multivariate binary sequence prediction with lstm,tensorflow keras timeseries lstm sequencetosequence,i will answer all question sequentially how do i get this working so that the model would forecast the next n sequences for both groups i would suggest two modifications to your model the first is using sigmoid activation for the last layer why consider binary cross entropy loss function i borrowed the equation from here where l is calculated loss p is network prediction and y is target values the loss is defined for if p is outside of this open interval range then the loss is undefined the default activation of lstm layer in keras is tanh and its output range is this implies that the output of the model is not suitable for binary crossentropy loss if you try to train the model you might end up getting nan for loss the second modification is part of the first modification either add sigmoid activation before the last layer for this you have three options add dense layer with sigmoid activation between your output and last lstm layer or change the activation of the lstm layer to sigmoid or add activation layer with sigmoid activation after the output layer even though all cases would work i would suggest using dense layer with sigmoid activation because it almost always works better now the model with suggested changes would be is it valid to attempt to output both a and b sequences by a single model or should i fit separate models ideally both cases could work but the latest studies such a this one show that the former casewhere you use a single model for both groups tends to perform better the approach is generally called as multi task learning the idea behind multitask learning is very broad for simplicity it can be thought of as adding inductive bias by forcing the model to learn hidden representations that are common for multiple tasks the prediction output is of shape when i would have expected it to be am i doing something wrong here you are getting this because you are using predictclasses method unlike predict method predictclasses method returns the maximum index of channels axisin your case third index as i explained above if you use sigmoid activation for the last layer and replaced predictclasses with predict you will get what you are expecting as far as the output lstm layer is concerned would it be a good idea to use an activation function here such as sigmoid whywhy not i hope ive explained this above the answer is yes is it valid to use a classification type loss binary crossentropy and metrics accuracy for optimizing a sequence since your targets are binary signalsthe distribution is bernoulli distribution yes it is valid to use binary loss and accuracy metrics this answer gives more details on why binary crossentropy is valid for this type of target variables is an lstm model an optimal choice here does anyone think that a crf or some hmmtype model would work better here this depends on the data available and the complexity of the network you choose crf and hmm networks are simple and work better if the available data is small but if the available dataset is large lstm will almost always outperform both crf and hmm my suggestion is if you have a lot of data use lstm but if either you have small data or looking for simple models you can use crf or hmm
53893214,guessing the categories for receipts,tensorflow machinelearning neuralnetwork lstm multilabelclassification,according to your explanation the problem which you are solving is a multiclass classification and not multilabel classification based on your examples if each receipt is mapped to only one category out of many possible categories then it is multiclass classification if each receipt could be mapped to more than one category out of many possible categories then it is multilabel classification for more explanation and to know about available algorithms in sklearn to solve these problems look here for more basic steps to work with text data read here edit you could have a separate model to predict the tax category for each receipt since building multiple multiclass model is relatively easier than single multilabel model

53448008,lstm multiple features prediction shape to give to data tensorflow,python tensorflow machinelearning neuralnetwork lstm,as for the input and output sizes you have defined them yourself in the picture you want to predict a vector of length numfeatures in your picture from an input matrix of shape n numfeatures where n is the number of samples to use for one prediction in tensorflow the placeholders usually have the shape batchsize numberofsteps numberoffeatures for you they could look like this in case you dont want to predefine n then you need to have a fixed batch size otherwise you could also have in which n would be fixed and your batch size variable you cannot have both variable as for your network size you need to experiment yourself it is impossible to make an a priori judgement on the require number of nodes layers etc
53376761,lstm making predictions on partial sequence,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,note this is just an idea and it might be wrong try it if you would like and i would appreciate any feedback is there a way to achieve what i want avoid extreme spikes while predicting probability or is that a given fact you can do this experiment set the returnsequences argument of last lstm layer to true and replicate the labels of each sample as much as the length of each sample for example if a sample has a length of and its label is then create a new label for this sample which consists of zeros you can probably easily do this using numpy function like nprepeat then retrain your new model and test it on new samples afterwards i am not sure of this but i would expect more monotonically increasingdecreasing probability graphs this time update the error you mentioned is caused by the fact that the labels should be a d array look at the output shape of last layer in the model summary use npexpanddims to add another axis of size one to the end the correct way of repeating the labels would look like this assuming ytrain has a shape of numsamples the experiment on imdb dataset actually i tried the experiment suggested above on the imdb dataset using a simple model with one lstm layer one time i used only one label per each sample as in original approach of shlomi and the other time i replicated the labels to have one label per each timestep of a sample as i suggested above here is the code if you would like to try it yourself then we can create the stateful replicas of the training models and run them on some test data to compare their results actually the first sample of xtest has a label ie belongs to negative class and the second sample of xtest has a label ie belongs to positive class so lets first see what the stateful prediction of testmodel ie the one that were trained using one label per sample for these two samples would look like the result testmodel stateful predictions correct label ie probability at the end ie timestep but very spiky and fluctuating in between now lets compare it with the stateful predictions of the reptestmodel ie the one that were trained using one label per each timestep the result reptestmodel stateful predictions again correct label prediction at the end but this time with a much more smoother and monotonic trend as expected note that this was just an example for demonstration and therefore i have used a very simple model here with just one lstm layer and i did not attempt to tune it at all i guess with a better tuning of the model eg adjusting the number of layers number of units in each layer activation functions used optimizer type and parameters etc you might get far better results

53190253,stateful lstm and stream predictions,python tensorflow keras lstm stateful,i think there might be an easier solution if your model does not have convolutional layers or any other layers that act upon the lengthsteps dimension you can simply mark it as statefultrue warning your model has layers that act on the length dimension the flatten layer transforms the length dimension into a feature dimension this will completely prevent you from achieving your goal if the flatten layer is expecting steps you will always need steps so before applying my answer below fix your model to not use the flatten layer instead it can just remove the returnsequencestrue for the last lstm layer the following code fixed that and also prepares a few things to be used with the answer below with this you will be able to train with steps and predict with one step otherwise it will not be possible the usage of a stateful model as a solution for your question first train this new model again because it has no flatten layer now with this trained model you can simply create a new model exactly the same way you created the trained model but marking statefultrue in all its lstm layers and we should copy the weights from the trained model since these new layers will need a fixed batch size keras rules i assumed it would be one single stream is coming not m streams and added it to the model creation above and voil just predict the outputs of the model with a single step when you decide that you reached the end of what you consider a continuous sequence call predictingmodelresetstates so you can safely start a new sequence without the model thinking it should be mended at the end of the previous one saving and loading states just get and set them saving with hpy working test for savingloading states considerations on the aspects of the data in your first model if it is statefulfalse it considers that each sequence in m is individual and not connected to the others it also considers that each batch contains unique sequences if this is not the case you might want to train the stateful model instead considering that each sequence is actually connected to the previous sequence and then you would need m batches of sequence m x or none

52959685,how to get the prediction of new data by lstm in python,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,i think the correct term in this context is forecasting a good explanation is after you train and test your model with the data that you already had as the other ones said here before me you want to predict future data which is i think the trully interresting thing about recurrent networks so in order to make this you need to start predicting the values from one day after your final date in your original dataset using the model which is trained with this past data once you predict this value you do the same thing but considering the last values predict and so on the fact that you are using a prediction to make others predictions implies that is much more difficult to get good results so is common to try to predict short ranges of time the exact code that you need to perform to do this could vary but i think that is the prime concept in the link below in the last part in which is perform a forecast the author show us a code and a explanation on how he did it i guess thats it
52869327,keras multistep lstm batch train classification at each step,python keras timeseries classification lstm,if you take a look at the modelsummary output you would realize what the problem is as you can see the output shape of lstm layer is none which means that only the output of last timestep is returned and as a result the output shape of dense layer is none which means that it would classify the whole input timeseries ie the whole day data of a stock in to one of classes this is not what you want rather you want to classify each timestep of the input timeseries to make this happen as vegardkt suggested you can pass returnsequencestrue to the lstm layer to have its output at each timestep lets look at the modelsummary output after this change as you can see now the lstm layer gives the output of each timestep and therefore the dense layer which acts a classifier would be able to classify each of those timesteps into one of classes as desired
52627739,how to merge numerical and embedding sequential models to treat categories in rnn,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,one solution as you mentioned is to onehot encode the categorical data or even use them as they are in indexbased format and feed them along the numerical data to an lstm layer of course you can also have two lstm layers here one for processing the numerical data and another for processing categorical data in onehot encoded format or indexbased format and then merge their outputs another solution is to have one separate embedding layer for each of those categorical data each embedding layer may have its own embedding dimension and as suggested above you may have more than one lstm layer for processing numerical and categorical features separately here is the model summary yet there is another solution which you can try just have one embedding layer for all the categorical features it involves some preprocessing though you need to reindex all the categories to make them distinct from each other for example the categories in first categorical feature would be numbered from to sizefirstcat and then the categories in the second categorical feature would be numbered from sizefirstcat to sizefirstcat sizesecondcat and so on however in this solution all the categorical features would have the same embedding dimension since we are using only one embedding layer update now that i think about it you can also reshape the categorical features in data preprocessing stage or even in the model to get rid of timedistributed layers and the reshape layer and this may increase the training speed as well model summary layer type output shape param connected to catinput inputlayer none catinput inputlayer none catinput inputlayer none embedding embedding none catinput embedding embedding none catinput embedding embedding none catinput numericinput inputlayer none concatenate concatenat none embedding e embedding embedding concatenate concatenat none numericinput e concatenate lstm lstm none concatenate total params kb trainable params kb nontrainable params byte as for fitting the model you need to feed each input layer separately with its own corresponding numpy array for example if you would like to use fitgenerator there is no difference

51921716,best approach for multiple time series prediction in tensor flow js,javascript tensorflow neuralnetwork lstm tensorflowjs,there are so many questions here what is the best approach to predict the next or or single y values of a time series rather than just the next value you simply need to return the sequence of the lstm if you want to predict the next values then the units of the last lstm layer should be with return returnsequences set to be true if you want to predict either or depending on your series then you can use a binarycrossentropy loss with a softmax activation for the last layer to compute a probability as for what is most likely the network will figure it out if the data is much consistent with your observation ie if is predicted in t then is likely to be predicted next at ti x requires normalization not sure how to handle this if we need to predict x into future values in order to predict y while doing all of this in a single network this is not specific to your use case it is a best practice to keep all data within the same range for data with high variance will tend to influence highly the model influencing the convergence you can normalize the x feature before feeding your model here is a function that will normalize the data across all features

51445857,signal classification based on keras stateful lstm,python tensorflow keras lstm recurrentneuralnetwork,you will only need true if youre facing ram issues in a statefulfalse case your xtrain should be shaped like patients variables or in the downsampled case patients variables your ytrain should be shaped like patients classes if your ram problem is with the numpy arrays and your pc go to the statefultrue case but if its an oom allocation with the gpu then you could try smaller batch sizes first in a statefultrue case this is a very nice question indeed in your case if you keep sequences that are long enough the class should probably be noticeable in every segment but if you do need the entire ecg to detect the problem then this approach may not be good and i dont know another approach at the moment for this approach xtrain should be patients variables and for ytrain you will need to repeat the classes for each segment patients classes when fitting you must remember to set shufflefalse and the organization of the data should be use resetstates every epoch
51360827,how to combine numerical and categorical values in a vector as input for lstm,python keras deeplearning lstm categoricaldata,there are variety of preprocessing that can be looked at while dealing with input of various ranges in general like normalization etc one hot representation is certainly a good way to represent categories embeddings are used when there too many category elements which makes one hot encoding very large they provide a vector representation potentially trainable that encodes a given input you can read more about them in the link below use of embeddings are very common in nlp that aside you could however take advantage of the fact that keras modelling supports multiple input layers for your specific case here is a made up example that might help you get started again i added few dense hidden layers just to demonstrate the point it should be self explanatory
51357008,where should i put the previous predicted sequence in lstm for optical character recognition systems,ocr lstm,no you dont have to feed recognized words back into lstm you only feed an input feature sequence and the lstm learns to propagate relevant information through this sequence you should think of input sequence and output sequence when talking about recurrent neural networks rnns the input to a rnn at timestep t is state of memory cell at t input element at t lstm has a more advanced internal structure than a vanilla rnn to allow more robust training but from a user perspective it works just like a vanilla rnn you input a sequence and lstm computes a output sequence for you when doing handwriting recognition you usually extract a feature sequence from the input image eg by using convolutional layers then you feed this feature sequence into lstm layers you map the output sequence to a characterprobability matrix which is then decoded into the final text by the ctc layer here is a short tutorial how to build a handwriting recognition system it should give you an idea of which data see data cnn output and rnn output flows into lstm and which data flows out of lstm

50672583,keras categorical vs continuous input to a lstm,python keras deeplearning lstm keraslayer,it seems the categorical input is confusing you to embed or not to embed we embed categorical input using an embedding layer for two cases reduce the dimension of the space and capture any similarities between the input so when you have billions of words in a language it makes sense to embed into dimensional vector to make it manageable but onehot always gives the most distinction so in your case is not a large number per say and onehot is the way to go for the continuous input we normalise often with a simple maxmin normalisation so max becomes and min becomes but there are many ways of doing it depending on the nature of your dataset for the actual model you can inputs that process continuous and categorical different and maybe share layers upstream otherwise creating different models might make sense you can find more information online that cover input encoding

49950865,using lstm to predict a simple synthetic time series why is it that bad,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,as already shown in primusas answer it is helpful to allow the recurrent layer to output its hidden state using returnsequencestrue together with a bidirectional layer which has been shown to better capture temporal patterns additionally i would argue that you need to have some sort of an intuition towards the kind of function youre trying to approximate trying to decompose it into a number of functions and constructing a subnetwork for each usually speeds up the learning process especially so when using appropriate activation combinations applying weight regularization is also relevant as it may stop the extreme divergence due to error accumulation note also that unless you use statefultrue you will need to provide the network with a long enough time frame to inspect longrange patterns ie the parabola is easy to approximate as a line if the timewindow is small concretely the below alterations achieve a still rapidly decreasing mse of e after epochs and ee after epochs with a lookback of note that i have also changed your optimizer to adam which i simply prefer
49930518,lstm timeseries prediction with multiple outputs,python keras timeseries lstm,your y shape does not match up with the last layer in your model your y is in the form of numsamples which means that for every sample it outputs a vector of length your last layer however is a dense layer which outputs numsamples which means that for every sample it outputs a vector of length since the output of your neural network and your ydata arent in the same format the neural network cannot train you can fix this in two ways convert the output of your neural network to the shape of your y data by replacing dense with dense convert the shape of your y data to the output of your neural network by modifying your createdataset function such that all of the features are added to the y instead of just one since you stated that you wanted to predict feature most likely you will be using the second option note that the second option does break the last part of your code to extend the y but your model trains fine

49558057,understanding rnn input for word prediction,tensorflow lstm prediction recurrentneuralnetwork,emm i guess you are using simple predict model maybe just for demonstrate we tried to use rnn to predict model with an basic idea that each word in a sentence will be affected by the former or the latter wordsthats what we called context so we use the sequential inputs of words in a sentence to represent words appear one by one with the time passes so we need a tensor with a shape batchsize wordscounts wordsrepresent and in your situation wordscounts is ninput represents time steps and the word represent tensor wordsrepresent is shape tuple but in real practice we not just transfer each word into an tuple we may use word embedding to create a meaningful and useful tensor represent of a word so maybe i guess that you have tried a simple demo or may i making mistakes

47020411,keras d target prediction,python tensorflow keras lstm keraslayer,first a hint if one sentence is supposed to generate the events i think you should not use inputlength but inputlengthlengthofthesentences its not an advantage to have an lstm layer that processes a sequence of length youre right to say that the repeatvector is causing identical results times now depending on how is your model supposed to detect those events a different approach may be better are these sentences a sequence where the events may be found along are these sentences an idea that determines the events statically following the second approach id say you could use the first lstm like this where hidden must be you may use more hidden layers whith returnsequencestrue but its important that the last has the amount of outputs compatible with then you reshape the result in the form of your events example

46534194,stateful lstm in keras reset with fit evaluate and predict,machinelearning deeplearning keras lstm stateful,indeed if you reset the states before evaluating the test set it will assume that the test sequence is a whole new sequence it will start it from the beginning if the general behavior of this entire sequence is not changing with time maybe the error will not be too significant but id not risk it if the test sequence is continuing the training sequence then it should start with proper states for best results but id say you should do this reset states these states are influenced by weights that were still not trained at the beginning of the last epoch evaluate train sequence to create new up to date states evaluate test sequence and then this reset states the evaluation needed to change the states predict train sequence create the states again predict test sequence not answered i dont know if the evaluate method will bring the states back to where they were before but i do believe it wont you may need to evaluate sequences that are long enough to fill your memory and then youd have to evaluate in batches offtopic misconception in the linked question in keras samples are sequences the dimensions in a batch for recurrent layers are sequences timesteps features where the number of sequences the number of samples and the batch size are exactly the same thing check the documentation to confirm that the second dimension is steps in a sequence
46459843,keras lstm predict timestep at a time,keras lstm,the first thing you need is to understand your data do these dimensions mean anything ill try to guess the purpose of timedistributed is to add that extra timesteps dimension so you can simulate a sequence in layers that are not supposed to work with sequences your error message is telling you this your inputshape parameter is none where none is the batch size number of samplesexamples your input data which is batch in your code is there is a mismatch you are supposed to use batches containing time steps as defined by your inputshape its ok for the statefulfalse model to pack images in a batch and train with that but later in the statefultrue case you will need that inputshape to be just one step you either create a new model just for predicting and copy all weights from the training model to the predicting model or you can try to use none in that time steps dimension meaning you can train and predict with different amounts of time steps now differently from the convolutionals the lstm layer is already expecting time steps so you should find a way to squeeze your data in less dimensions the lstm will expect none timesteps features the time steps are the same as the previous for training for predicting and you could try to go with none there so instead of a flatten inside a timedistributed you should simply reshape the data condensing the dimensions that are not batch size or steps the are the sides of the preceding convolutional and its filters im just not sure the sides are maybe theyre you can see in the current modelsummary finally for the statefultrue case you will have to define the model with batchshape instead of inputshape the amount of samples in a batch must be a fixed number because the model will assume the samples in the second batch are new steps belonging to the samples in the previous batch the number of samples will then need to be the same for all batches

44793250,training lstm network and predicting with different starting points,python tensorflow lstm,i suspect that since you are starting your predictions at an arbitrary starting point in the future there is a gap of values between what your model was trained on and what it is starting to see for predictions and the state of your lstm has not updated with the values in that gap update in your code you have this and then during training this i would suggest feeding the initial state into dynamicrnn and refeeding the updated state at each training iteration something like this and during training so this way your model not only learns the parameters during training but also keeps track of everything that its seen during training in the state now you save this state with the rest of your session and use it during the prediction stage the small difficulty with this is that technically this state is a placeholder so it wont be saved in the graph automatically in my experience so you create another variable manually at the end of training and assign the state to it this way it is saved in the graph for later so now once you restore the graph if you want to start your predictions after some artificial gap then somehow you still have to run your model through this gap so as to update the state in my case i just run one dummy prediction for the whole gap just so as to update the state and then you continue at your normal intervals from here hope this helps
44440390,keras classification over time,keras shapes lstm,the model you provided expects a target for each timestep of a sequence if you have only one target for the whole sequence and the shape of the targets in the error message suggests that you need to modify the model in the following way set returnsequences to false and remove the timedistributed wrapper
44386348,understanding lstm model using tensorflow for sentiment analysis,python machinelearning tensorflow deeplearning lstm,this is loaded question let me try to put it in simple english hiding all the complicated inner details a simple unrolled lstm model with steps is shown below each lstm cell takes an input vector and the hidden output vector of the previous lstm cell and produces an output vector and the hidden output for the next lstm cell a concise representation of the same model is shown below lstm models are sequence to sequence models ie they are used for problems when a sequence has to be labeled with an another sequence like pos tagging or ner tagging of each word in a sentence you seem to be using it for classification problem there are two possible ways to use lstm model for classification take the output of all the states o o and o in our example and apply a softmax layer with softmax layer output size being equal to number of classes in your case take the output of the last state o and apply a softmax layer to it this is what you are doing in your cod outputs return the last row in the outputs so we back propagate backpropagation through time btt on the error of the softmax output coming to the implementation using tensorflow lets see what is the input and output to the lstm model each lstm takes an input but we have such lstm cells so the input x placeholder should be of size inputsize time steps but we dont calculate error for single input and btt for it but instead we do it on a batch of input output combinations so the input of lstm will be batchsize inputsize time steps a lstm cells is defined with the size of hidden state the size of output and the hidden output vector of the lstm cell will be same as the size of the hidden states check lstm internal calcuations for why we then define an lstm model using a list of these lstm cells where the size of the list will be equal to the number of unrolling of the model so we define the number of unrolling to be done and the size of input during each unrolling i have skipped lots of things like how to handle variable length sequence sequence to sequence error calcuations how lstm calcuates output and hidden output etc coming to your implementation you are applying a relu layer before the input of each lstm cell i dont understand why you are doing that but i guess you are doing it to map your input size to that of the lstm input size coming to your questions x is the placeholder tensormatrixndarray of size none inputvecsize ie it can take variable number of rows but each row with inputvecsize columns and each element being a vector is size normally placeholders are defined with none in the rows so that we can vary the batch size of the input lets say inputvecsize you are passing a ndarray of size x tftransposex x tfreshapex hlayerweights x tfnnrelutfmatmulx hlayerweights hlayerbiases no input size are hidden size are different lstm does a set of operations on the input and previous hidden output and given an output and next hidden output both of which are of size hidden size x tfplaceholderfloat none inputvecsize it defines a tensor or ndarray or variable number of rows each rows has inputvecsize columns an and each value is a single value vector x tfreshapex reshapes the input x into a matrix of size fixed to column and any number of rows batchx batchxreshapebatchsize inputvecsize batchxreshape will fail if number of values in batchx batchsizeinputvecsize this might be the case for last batch because lentrainx might not be a multiple of batchsize resulting in the non fully filled last batch you can avoid this problem by using but i am still not sure why you are using relu in front of the input layer you are applying logistic regression at the output of the last cell which is fine you can look my toy example which is a classifier using bidirectional lstm for classifying if a sequence is increasing or decreasing or mixed toy sequenceclassifier using lstm in tensorflow
43881364,why can model not even predict sine,python keras lstm recurrentneuralnetwork,i see multiple issues with your code your value for lookback is which means the lstm sees only one sample at a time which is obviously not sufficient to learn anything about the sequence you probably did this so that you can make the final prediction at the end by feeding the prediction from the previous step as the new input to correct way to make this work is to train with more timesteps and then change to network to a stateful lstm with a single timestep also when you do the final prediction you have to show the network more than one ground truth sample otherwise the position on the sine is ambigious is it going up or down in the next step i slapped together q quick example here is how i generated the data here i trained the model and here i changed the trained model to allow the continues prediction here is what the result looks like the prediction errors add up and very quickly it diverges from the input sine but it clearly learned the general shape of sines you can now try to improve on this by trying different layers activation functions etc

43702481,why does keras lstm batch size used for prediction have to be the same as fitting batch size,deeplearning keras lstm,unfortunately what you want to do is impossible with keras ive also struggle a lot of time on this problems and the only way is to dive into the rabbit hole and work with tensorflow directly to do lstm rolling prediction first to be clear on terminology batchsize usually means number of sequences that are trained together and numsteps means how many time steps are trained together when you mean batchsize and just predicting the next value i think you meant to predict with numsteps otherwise it should be possible to train and predict with batchsize meaning you are training on sequences and make predictions every time step one for each sequence meaning trainingprediction numsteps however i think what you mean is that you want to use stateful lstm to train with numsteps and do prediction with numsteps theoretically this make senses and should be possible and it is possible with tensorflow just not keras the problem keras requires an explicit batch size for stateful rnn you must specify batchinputshape batchsize numsteps features the reason keras must allocate a fixedsize hidden state vector in the computation graph with shape batchsize numunits in order to persist the values between training batches on the other hand when statefulfalse the hidden state vector can be initialized dynamically with zeroes at the beginning of each batch so it does not need to be a fixed size more details here possible work around train and predict with numsteps example this might or might not work at all for your problem as the gradient for back propagation will be computed on only one time step see my solution use tensorflow in tensorflow you can train with batchsize numsteps then do predictions with batchsize numsteps this is possible by creating a different model graph for training and prediction sharing the same rnn weight matrices see this example for nextcharacter prediction and blog post note that one graph can still only work with one specified batchsize but you can setup multiple model graphs sharing weights in tensorflow

43477293,lstm onestepahead prediction with tensorflow,tensorflow lstm,this is an great question i asked something very similar here the idea being instead of sharing weights across time one element atatime as you describe it each time step gets its own set of weights i believe there are several reasons for training onestep at a time mainly computational complexity and training difficulty the number of weights youll need to train grows linearly for each time step youd need some pretty sporty hardware to train long sequences also for long sequences youll need a very large data set to train all those weights but imho i am still optimistic that for the right problem with sufficient resources it would show improvement

43336630,when predicting with an lstm in keras is the hidden state still adjusted,sequence keras prediction lstm,basic operation of a neural network is to take an input vector which is connected to the output with connections and sometimes other layers such as context layers these connections are modelled as matrices and vary in strength we call these weight matrices this means that the only thing we do when we are feeding data into the network is to put a vector into the network multiply the values with the weight matrix and call that the output in special cases like recurrent networks we even keep some values stored in other vectors and combine this stored value with the current input during training we not only feed data into the network we also compute an error value that we evaluate in a clever way so that it tells us how we should change the weight matrices we multiply our inputs and possibly past inputs for recurrent layers with therefore yes of course the basic execution behavior does not change for recurrent layers we are just not updating weights anymore there are layers that do behave differently during execution time because they are treated as regularisers ie methods that make training the network more efficient which are deemed as unnecessary during execution examples for these layers are noise and batchnormalization almost all neural network layers including recurrent ones include dropout which is another form of regularisation which disables a random percentage of connections in the layer this is also only done during training

42749541,sequence prediction lstm neural network is falling behind,neuralnetwork lstm recurrentneuralnetwork,clearing the network context before every training iteration is the fix the problem in your code is that your network is trained circular instead of training reset youre training the network this makes your network believe that the value after should be second of all there is no reason to use output neurons having one is enough output equals heads output equals tails well just round the output instead of using synaptic i used neataptic in this code it is an improved version of synaptic adding functionality and genetic algorithms the code the code is fairly simple uglyfying it a little it looks like this run the code here the key to this code is clear true this basically makes sure that the network knows it is starting from the first training sample and not continuing from the last training sample the size of the lstm iteration count and learning rate are fully customisable success please do note that it takes about x the pattern for the network to learn it it does have problems with nonrepetitive patterns though
42633644,using keras for video prediction time series,machinelearning neuralnetwork timeseries keras lstm,so basically every approach has its advantages and disadvantages lets go throught the ones you provided and then other to find the best approach lstm among their biggest advantages is an ability to learn a longterm dependiencies patterns in your data they were designed in order to be able to analyse long sequences like eg speech or text this is also might cause problems because of number parameters which could be really high other typical recurrent network architectures like gru might overcome this issues the main disadvantage is that in their standard sequential implementation its infeasible to fit it on a video data for the same reason why dense layers are bad for an imagery data loads of time and spatial invariances must be learnt by a topology which is completely not suited for catching them in an efficient manner shifting a video by a pixel to the right might completely change the output of your network other thing which is worth to mention is that training lstm is belived to be similiar to finding equilibrium between two rivalry processes finding good weights for a denselike output computations and finding a good innermemory dynamic in processing sequences finding this equilibrium might last for a really long time but once its finded its usually quite stable and produces a really good results convd among their biggest advantages one may easily find an ability to catch spatial and temporal invariances in the same manner as convd in an imagery case this make the curse of dimensionality much less harmful on the other hand in the same way as convd might not produce good results with a longer sequences in the same way a lack of any memory might make learning a long sequence harder of course one may use different approaches like timedistributed convd using a timedistributed wrapper one may use some pretrained convnet like eg inception framewise and then analyse the feature maps sequentially a really huge advantage of this approach is a possibility of a transfer learning as a disadvantage one may think about it as a convd it lacks temporal analysis of your data convlstm this architecture is not yet supported by the newest version of keras on march th but as one may see here it should be provided in the future this is a mixture of lstm and convd and its belived to be better then stacking convd and lstm of course these are not the only way to solve this problem ill mention one more which might be usefull stacking one may easily stack the upper methods in order to build their final solution eg one may build a network where at the beginning video is transformed using a timedistributedresnet then output is feed to convd with multiple and agressive spatial pooling and finally transformed by an grulstm layer ps one more thing that is also worth to mention is that shape of video data is actually d with frames width height channels ps in case when your data is actually d with frames width hieght you actually could use a classic convd by changing channels to frames to analyse this data which actually might more computationally effective in case of a transfer learning you should add additional dimension because most of cnn models were trained on data with shape width height one may notice that your data doesnt have channels in this case a technique which is usually used is repeating spatial matrix three times ps an example of this d approach is

58497442,best training methods for binary text classification using docvec gensim,machinelearning gensim docvec,theres an example included in gensim of using docvec for sentimentclassification very close to your need see its likely a better model than the other tutorials you link in particular the second tutorial youve linked currently has a very erroneous mismanagement of alpha in its misguided loop calling train multiple times specifically with regard to your questions train with as much data both inside and outside the desired class as possible a model thats only seen positive examples is unlikely to generate meaningful vectors from documents totally unlike those its been trained on in particular with a model like docvec it only knows words its seen during training and if you later try to infer vectors for new documents with unknown words those words are ignored entirely yes a classifier of any algorithm is fed features and knownlabels it then learns to deduce those labels from those features traditionally docvec is trained with one unique id tag per document and no knownlabel information so each document gets its own vector and the process is totally unsupervised its possible to instead give documents multiple tags or use the same tag on more than one document and you could make those tags match knownlabels so all sports docs share sports tag either in addition to their uniqueid or instead of it but doing this adds a number of other complications over the simple oneidtagperdocument case so i wouldnt recommend trying anything in that direction until youve got the simpler case working i have seen a few cases where mixing in knownlabels as extra tags can help a little especially in multiclass classification issues where such extra labels each only apply to a small subset of all documents but its not assured and thus only makes sense to tinker with that after you have a working straightforward baseline and repeatable way to evaluate alternate models against each other
58195364,text classification model using docvec and gensim,python machinelearning gensim docvec,it sounds as if youre training a separate docvec model for each forums inout decision then using an improvised set of infervectormostsimilar operations to make a decision thats a very rough adhoc approach and you should look into intros to more formal textclassification approaches where there is a clear step of featurediscovery which might include creating docvec vectors for your texts or other techniques then a clear step of classifiertraining then evaluation you might also at that point then be training larger models which include labeled training examples from all forums and classifiers which pick oneofmany possible classes separately several things are wrong or nonoptimal in your docvec training including its almost always misguided to be calling train more than once in your own loop or to be changing the default alphaminalpha values you current code is in fact making modelepochs passes over the data for every call and often decrementing alpha by hundreds of times into nonsensensical negative values call train just once with the desired number of epochs with default alphaminalpha values and it will do the right thing and dont trust whatever online tutorialexample suggested the above looping calls your hs will turn the strictly onoff hierarchicalsoftmax mode on but leaves the default negative parameter in place so your model will be using a nonstandard and probably unhelpful and slow combination of both negativesampling and hierarchicalsoftmax training its better to use either some negative value and hs for pure negativesampling or negative hs for pure hierarchicalsoftmax or just stick with the default negative hs unlessuntil everything is already working and you want to descend into deeper optimizations mincount is rarely the best option these models often benefit from discarding rare words after correcting these issues you may find that more data then tends to bring the usual expected improved results and if it doesnt at that time doublecheck that all text preprocessingtokenization is done right at training and inference and evaluation and if youre still having problems perhaps post a new question then with more specificsnumbers about where expected improvements have instead scored worse

79144629,why to use combined loss function for segmentation and classification,pythonx deeplearning tfkeras lossfunction,there is no such thing as separate loss functions in tensorflow when you ask it to minimize a multidimensional object eg numbers it simply adds them so there is no real choice between joint or separate the confusing thing about tensorflow is that it adds these number implicitly without telling you what are the real options here a single loss function potentially with weight alpha so alphal alphal the perks are relative simplicity only one added hyperparameter and in general this is the most common approach in all of machine learning note that you dont need beta at all it is meaningless here just use alpha and alpha separate optimization procedures not just losses this can take many forms you can have separate adams that you call opne after the other in each iteration this gives more flexibility allows separate statistics per loss etc but it is hard to do you end up with a huge design space multiple hyperparameters to choose so unless you are an experienced researcher who knows exactly what they are doing you are unlikely to really benefit from it this also includes things like null space projections etc or using one loss as pretraining and then separate training procedure that train s the main one when you mention problem you probably mean that the main loss started behaving badly in general adding an auxiliary loss has no guarantee to help you typically people just tune the weights so if you have alphamain loss alphanew loss just start with alpha things should behave exactly as without new loss if they dont you have a bug once this is tested slowly decrease alpha check etc plot the behaviour and decide what works for you if you want to learn more about various challenges of auxiliary losses take a look at which has toy problems showing why it can sometimes help and sometimes do the opposite

78212101,deep learning models yielding high training accuracy but poor performance on testing data in binary text classification,python tensorflow machinelearning keras deeplearning,the problem you are facing is probably overfitting overfitting occurs when an algorithm fits too closely or even exactly to its training data resulting in a model that cant make accurate predictions or conclusions from any unseen data you can learn more about it here the reason why other models are working better may be due to the fact that deep learning models can be prone to overfitting especially when the model is too complex or the amount of training data is insufficient random forest with its ensemble approach inherently has a regularization effect which can help prevent overfitting probable solutions to your problem could be things like collecting more data this could help with generalization simplifying your model you can try by less number of layers or less complex architecture regularization there are plenty of methods like weight or feature regularization there are other ways to avoid overfitting you can search and see which one is best for your project
78099962,training a cnn to predict a parameter of a function,tensorflow deeplearning neuralnetwork convneuralnetwork regression,consider the inputs to be xiyi and the output ki where xiki yi for a standard inputactivation you cannot have the result of this activation function to be k you can categorize k though the idea would be to categorize k enough that the value can be a scalar think of just positive x y and k thus the crossover is when k with this idea you can build enough outputs to categorize k into a range of values if we use two points we dont have to do division now we can see the slope is x x this is what we should see from your example since you always use the same linspec i suspect from your poolingconvolutions youve somehow eliminated the possibility of this training route i made the input and i changed the model that model and data learns to predict k its really just calculating the difference between different y values
78092923,how to compute the parameters in the cnn classifier,deeplearning pytorch convneuralnetwork,this is a typical question when it comes to cnn there are many posts alike where users encounter the same type of error originating from this runtimeerror mat and mat shapes cannot be multiplied ixj and kxl i will provide a canonical answer here when working with nnconvd intermediate tensors will be fourdimensional b c h w convolutions work spatially they move across the tensor across the height and width dimensions for d convs the number of output channels is determined by the number of filters in the convolution layer which operates independently of each other you can read more about convolution layers and sizes in understanding convolutional layers shapes when it comes to cnn architectures you have to accommodate for a change in dimensionality when moving from the convolutional part feature extractor to the fully connected layers classifier in the general case the tensor shape is going from d to d this requires some form of spatiality reduction either via flattening leading to a shape of b chw this can be done using nnflatten or using a pooling operation such as a maximum nnmaxpoold or average pooling nnadaptiveavgpoold resulting in a reduced shape of b c h w if h and w are not singletons a flattening operation is still necessary ultimately the output shape of the last convolution layer depends on two things the input shape and the number and sizes of convolutions preceding it the above error refers to a shape mismatch between the output of the cnn and the shape expected by the linear layer i is the batch size j is the actual flattened feature length k is the infeatures of the first linear layer and l is its outfeatures so in case you get this error you already know which infeatures to use to anticipate this error and avoid throwing it while debugging the architecture another way to determine infeatures is by truncating the model removing all linear layers and performing inference with dummy data observing the output shape of that inference will inform you of the infeatures to adopt therefore the spatial dimension is x and the channel count is so the feature dimension is in this case the first linear layer must be initialized as nnlinear biastrue since version there exists a class nnlazylinear which infers the infeatures automatically at runtime during the first inference of the model in this case no need to perform the dummy inference yourself simply use nnlazylinear biastrue

78040679,trouble with binary classification using hingeembeddingloss function,python machinelearning deeplearning pytorch logisticregression,have you read the documentation for hingeembeddingloss measures the loss given an input tensor and a labels tensor containing or this is usually used for measuring whether two inputs are similar or dissimilar eg using the l pairwise distance as and is typically used for learning nonlinear embeddings or semisupervised learning the x in hingeembeddingloss is supposed to be distances between paired embeddings it doesnt apply at all to your prediction problem you are actually telling the model to do the opposite of what you want for the loss computation the loss is x when y and marginx when y meaning when y you are telling the model to produce a small value and vice versa when y you also have errors from incorrect broadcasting loss criterionoutputsqueeze ytrainlong produces a nn loss rather than a n loss this error is also present in your accuracy calculation if you remove the broadcasting errors and compute accuracy as the opposite sign ypredsignlong yvalfloatmean the training setup somewhat works overall the correct way to approach this problem is to use binary classification which as you mention works if you need the output to be on you can just rescale the sigmoid logits from to after prediction
77947679,models predictions always,tensorflow machinelearning keras deeplearning transformermodel,it sounds like the model is adapting the training set but not generalising to the test set this is overfitting behaviour which seems likely to happen because you have relatively few samples compared to the model size samples vs million parameters to help the net generalise better without modifying your existing model too much here are some ideas use adamw rather than adam and set its regularisation weightdecay parameter to a large value this will effectively shrink the number of parameters the model is allowed to easily tap into using a smaller batch size will regularise the training start with or and experiment with doubling the batch size until you find a spot where its both reasonably quick to train and also has decent metrics each time you increase the batch size consider decreasing the learning rate reduce the size of the transformer layer also try reducing the embedding size or model size of the embedding layer add dropout layers at each stage start with just one and monitor the change as you add more dropout layers usually worth tweaking the learning rate after each change especially if the net becomes unstable using early stopping in conjunction with the above will likely also help id start with some of the above points otherwise the model might be overfitting almost immediately it may also help to preprocess your data down to fewersmaller features using sklearn or a neural network try one thing at a time and observe its effect on the validation set metrics i wouldnt focus too much on the test set accuracy for now because its a biased metric in favour of the majority class worth looking more at recall and precision initially or use the f score which combines them into a single number the recall and precision should improve as the model becomes able to discern positive cases recall and does so with precision the train score will go down at the same time and these trends mean the model is generalising better
77900830,why use dim when using torchsoftmax for getting predictions probabilities,multidimensionalarray deeplearning pytorch tensor torchvision,its hard to say why it might be in the tutorial but usually you have batchnumber yourdata shape as input in your network output in case of classification usually has batchnumber numberofclasses and youre right that in that case you should use dimor recommended way use even dim because you can have more complicated output for example batchnumber somemoredata numberofclasses to get model confidence along dim which sum to but sometimes in architecture of deep network might reshape dimension of the data for some purpose then you can check in what dimension numberofclasses is and other part of question the difference between of argmax and softmax is that first one returns the confidences along number of classes the second one returns the one class index with the highest confidence for each sample usually you apply softmax and then argmax in order to get final class index hope it helps
77878901,from predicted array padding same shows grid tiles in reconstructed image,python tensorflow machinelearning imageprocessing deeplearning,now that i understood this my problem is not the small black box this is some bad pixel my problem is the square tile border lines this is a stitching problem in my opinion the border lines come from your approach to crop the full tiles and then stitch them back together later due to the padding of your convolutions in your model architecture it is expected to have border artifacts there are two things you can do now train and process on larger tiles and then crop the center tile this does away with the padding issue by cutting away the problematic parts the result looks like this of course this does not completely solve the stitching problem entirely as a next step you can experiment with aggregating overlapping segments of the tiles to get this smoother this smoothing through aggregation can also be done as a postprocessing step eg via a gaussian filtering or morphological operations or you use some opencv denoising make sure to further optimize the hyperparameters result now is this full code to reproduce i changed a few other things eg model saving etc the updated answer ends here so i think this is mainly about post processing and visualization of your data i visualize like this now i can already clearly see the black square so next i will be trying some thresholding to get enhance that visibility in postprocessing i am thinking of something like that which leaves me with this not sure how good this scales across your full dataset but this is definitely in the ballpark for some morphological operators in postprocessing

77716617,my model is predicting completely opposite values after training ie predicting circles inside values as outside and outside values as inside,machinelearning deeplearning pytorch,the model returns this logit x x roptimal the return value above is such that samples inside roptimal return a negative value and samples outside of roptimal return a positive value we can follow this through to the predicted class yhat sample inside roptimal model returns negative value sigmoidnegative is similarly for a sample outside roptimal sample outside roptimal model returns positive value sigmoidpositive is so yhat round so samples that are insideoutside roptimal will get yhatyhat but this is the reverse of your training set where the actual labels are yy one way to fix this is to reverse the sign of the return value that will mean samples inside the circle return a positive value and will get a predicted class of yhat roundsigmoidve
77708146,my autoencoder was not learning to predict value updated,python keras deeplearning neuralnetwork,i ran it on some digits images in sklearn so i increased the input shape from to and set the predictor output shape to classes i normalised the input data and used a smaller batch size input data x is a dimensional binary vector eg sample and y is a dimensional multilabel indicator target the multilabel information is y is is odd is prime is multiple of i used binary crossentropy loss for both x and y this is to strongly penalise wrong digits both the decoder and prediction outputs are sigmoid i removed the dropout layer as it seemed to hurt performance and threw in some batch norm layers i used the nadam optimizer i run fit for epoch and then manually calculate the train and validation accuracies before running the next epoch initially i was using keras accuracy values but found them to be incorrect for some outputs loss and accuracy curves the solid lines are loss and show that the model is converging the model memorises the train y dotted orange and on the validation y it gets about right dashed orange so its performance with y is quite good it doesnt perfectly reconstruct x it gets x exactly right about of the time dotted blue and on the validation x it only gets it exactly right although its reconstructions seem to have relatively low accuracy this is because if only a single digit is wrong in the dim reconstruction it is considered incorrect according to the metric specified in the comments its actual reconstructions are close to the originals and look quite good even though it doesnt get x exactly right it is often very close differing by a pixel here or there left original x train right reconstruction since the reconstructions are close to the originals to me that suggests the latent space is not bad and is perhaps usable i think something to consider is whether x needs to be exact if one is interpolating ie making up new values in latent space

75250342,neural network built from scratch in python to classify digits stuck at percent accuracy i am using the mnist dataset,python machinelearning deeplearning neuralnetwork,the one problem that i can see is that you are using only weights but no biases they are very important because they allow your model to change the position of the decision plane boundary in the solution space if you only have weights you can only angle the solution i guess that basically this is the best fit you can get without biases the dense layer is basically a linear function wx b and you are missing the b see the pytorch documentation for the example also can you show your xavier initialization in your case even the simple normal distributed values would be enough as initialization no need to rush into more advanced topics i would also suggest you start from the smaller problem for example iris dataset and no hidden layers just a simple linear regression that learns by using gradient descent then you can expand it by adding hidden layers and then by trying harder problems with the code you already have

74092502,how to process strong imbalaced data for multilabel with transfer learning,python keras deeplearning multilabelclassification imbalanceddata,balancing datasets for training is always tricky and only a few approaches can help get more data to balance out the dataset this is obvious but also unreasonable in many cases reduce the size of the larger classes this works sometimes but youre also left with a very small set of images sometimes adding class weights to try and balance the dataset ie the weight is inversely proportional to the number of images of that class meaning images from the lesser class will impact the model more than images from the greater class remove the classes with images that are too low on group them as other kind of a workaround doesnt solve the problem but often used in business settings living with it if the data proportioned accurately reflect how it is in real life ie identifying humans and cars many more humans than there are cars and your test scenario is also filled with images of that proportion it might not even be that disadvantageous to leave the imbalance in your model will identify humans much more accurately than cars but its fine as the bias works in your favor personally i try to use and whenever possible to see if it can increase my model accuracy otherwise sometimes is the best for business cases

71000059,pytorch multiclass segmentation loss value when using target the prediction,deeplearning pytorch computervision imagesegmentation,i would like to adress this i expect the loss to be when the output is the same as the target if the prediction matches the target ie the prediction corresponds to a onehotencoding of the labels contained in the dense target tensor but the loss itself is not supposed to equal to zero actually it can never be equal to zero because the nncrossentropyloss function is always positive by definition let us take a minimal example with number of c classes and a target ypred and a prediction ypred consisting of prefect predictions as a quick reminder the softmax is applied on the logits qi as pi logexpqisumjexpqj similarly if you are using the logsoftmax defined as logpi logpi then comes the negative likelihood function computed between x the input and y the target yx in association with the softmax it comes down to yp or ylogp respectively in any case whether you apply the log or not only the predictions corresponding to the true classes will remain since the others ones are zeroedout that being said applying the nllloss on ypred would indeed result with a as you expected in your question however here we apply it on the probability distribution or logprobability p or logp respectively in our specific case pi for the true class and pi for all other classes there are c of those this means the softmax of the logit associated with the true class will equal to expsumipi and since sumipi cexp exp we therefore have similarly for logsoftmax if we proceed by applying the negative likelihood function we simply get crossentropyypred ytrue nllloss o logsoftmaxypred ytrue this results in this effectively corresponds to the minimum of the nncrossentropyloss function regarding your specific case where c you may have an issue in your code since the average loss should equal to log e ie around you can see for yourself with one of the provided methods the builtin function nnfunctionalcrossentropy manually computing the quantity analytical result

70786197,why is trainingset accuracy during fit different to accuracy calculated right after using predict on same data,python tensorflow machinelearning keras deeplearning,one reason this can happen is the last accuracy reported takes into account the entire epoch with its parameters non constant and still being optimized when evaluating the model the parameters stop changing and they remain in their final hopefully most optimized state unlike during the last epoch for which the parameters were in all kinds of hopefully less optimized states more so at the start of the epoch deleted because i now see you didnt use batch norm in this case i am assuming this is due to batchnormalization see for example here during training a moving average is used during inference we already have the normalization parameters this is likely to be the cause of the difference please try without it and see if still such drastic differences exist

70679208,how do instance segmentation methods deal with partially labelled data,deeplearning imagesegmentation,it depends on the formulation of the learning setup if you consider each a collection of samples ie objects contained therein each with their bounding box and a label in cat dog you should be fine in essence you will be asking for the generation of a bounding box and a label each one of which will be matched to a ground truth wrong predictions of a bounding box or label will generate an error signal by contrasting them to the corresponding truth which means you have something to penalize your model for or train it with missing labels will not be contrasted with anything basically meaning that you are simply underutilizing your images which is not in itself a deal breaker if on the other hand you are generating all bounding boxes from a single image and penalizing your model for creating redundant boxes you run the risk of penalizing correct predictions that are unlabeled which is indeed bad if the count of penalized good predictions is comparable to penalized bad predictions you would be doing more harm than good perhaps the way to go would be to start with training only on images that have a full and correct labeling and then move on to include the noisy ones manually checking whether the extra predictions actually correspond to real but unlabeled entities then fixing the data as need a la humanintheloop training
70659159,valueerror input of layer sequential is incompatible with the layer in prediction,python tensorflow deeplearning convneuralnetwork,edit after some fiddling this was the solution on the one hand there was an error with the final dimension of the input the in the the inputshape this represents the number of channels think of rgb channels in an image to expand our spectrogram we can use either spectrogram spectrogramreshapespectrogramshape or spectrogram npexpanddimsspectrogram at this point the shape of spectrogram would be on the other hand during inference the first dimension was removed because tensorflow would interpret it as the batch dimension you can solve this by wrapping the spectrogram in a one element numpy array like this now spectrograms shape is which is exactly what we need original this is definitely more of a comment than an answer but i cannot write those due to a lack in reputation so feel free to move it to comments so the problem is that the expected shape and thus the architecture of your network and your datas shape dont match i guess thats because the predict call expects you to hand over a batch look at the first dimension of each shape of samples to evaluate you may get around this by wrapping the spectrogram argument inside the predict call with a list vcprediction voicemodelpredictspectogram if this doesnt do the trick id recommend to further investigate the shapes of training and evaluation data i like to do this during runtime in debug mode
70626098,can a neural network having nonlinear activation function say relu be used for linear classification task,deeplearning neuralnetwork nonlinear,the mathematical argument lies in a power to represent linearity we can use following three lemmas to show that lemma with affine transformations linear layer we can map the input hypercube d into arbitrary small box abk proof is quite simple we can just make all the biases to be equal to a and make weights multiply by ba lemma for sufficiently small scale many nonlinearities are approximately linear this is actually very much a definition of a derivative or taylor expansion in particular let us take relux for x it is in fact linear what about sigmoid well if we look at a tiny tiny region eps eps you can see that it approaches a linear function as eps lemma composition of affine functions is affine in other words if i were to make a neural network with multiple linear layers it is equivalent of having just one this comes from the matrix composition rules combining the above composing the three lemmas above we see that with a nonlinear layer there always exists an arbitrarily good approximation of the linear function we simply use the first layer to map entire input space into the tiny part of the preactivation spacve where your linearity is approximately linear and then we map it back in the following layer general case this is a very simple proof now in general you can use universal approximation theorem to show that a nonlinear neural network sigmoid relu many others that is sufficiently large can approximate any smooth target function which includes linear ones this proof originally given by cybenko is however much more complex and relies on showing that specific classes of functions are dense in the space of continuous functions

66704712,keras classification which class is assigned probability and using functional api,keras deeplearning,is that the probability of being class a or the probability of not being class a ie b not really say you got as an output from sigmoid so that does not mean your network output probabilities for each classes as sigmoid outputs do not sum up to in other words having an output does not indicate there is a chance of that output belongs to other classes with probability also in binary classification with sigmoid network outputs py then by definition of probability py py they add up to one only for simple binary classification if you want to see the probabilities of each class you should use softmax activation as its output will sum up to you can interpret softmax outputs as probabilities on the other hand these models are not probabilistic models but deterministic models so interpreting outputs of softmax as probabilities is common but there is no mathematical connection between them also is there a way to set which class i want the probability for you can set various of thresholds ie mostly but that depends on your data and problem you can change the threshold to see how it effects the aucroc by interpreting the changes you can conclude a threshold that fits best for you if you want to determine the classes you can use note that is the threshold and you can change it here if output is bigger than than we say it belongs to second class
66648865,keras deep learning valueerror logits and labels must have the same shape none vs none,python imageprocessing keras deeplearning,youre using binarycrossentropy so the output layer of your model should contain only neuron the calculation is if the output value is greater than its otherwise the output is you can also tune that threshold though to fix your problem please change the following line to

66452884,high accuracy during training and validation low accuracy during prediction with the same dataset,python tensorflow machinelearning keras deeplearning,since you use a last layer of you should not use lossbinarycrossentropy in modelcompile but losscategoricalcrossentropy instead due to this mistake the results shown during model fitting are probably wrong the results returned by sklearns fscore are the real ones irrelevant to your question as i guess the followup one will be how to improve it we practically never use activationtanh for the hidden layers try relu instead also dropout should not be used by default especially with such a high value of commentout all dropout layers and only add them back if your model overfits using dropout when it is not needed is known to hurt performance
66438514,calculating probability of a classification model prediction,machinelearning deeplearning classification bertlanguagemodel multiclassclassification,bertforsequenceclassification returns logits ie the classification scores before normalization you can normalize the scores by calling fsoftmaxoutput dim where torchnnfunctional was imported as f with thousands of labels the normalization can be costly and you do not need it when you are only interested in argmax this is probably why the models return the raw scores only
66416878,target and output shapetype for binary classification using pytorch,python deeplearning pytorch classification,binary classification is slightly different than multilabel classification while for multilabel your model predicts a vector of logits per sample and uses softmax to converts the logits to probabilities in the binary case the model predicts a scalar logit per sample and uses the sigmoid function to convert it to class probability in pytorch the softmax and the sigmoind are folded into the loss layer for numerical stability considerations and therefore there are different cross entropy loss layers for the two cases nnbcewithlogitsloss for the binary case with sigmoid and nncrossentropyloss for the multilabel case with softmax in your case you want to use the binary version with sigmoid nnbcewithlogitsloss thus your labels should be of type torchfloat same float type as the output of the network and not integers you should have a single label per sample thus if your batch size is the target should have shape ill leave it here as an exercise to show that training a model with two outputs and cesoftmax is equivalent to binary outputsigmoid
66345286,even when using sequential model i am getting attributeerror model object has no attribute predictclasses,python deeplearning classification recurrentneuralnetwork,the error is caused by the fact that you were not calling your function in order to get its output simply do predicted buildmodelrnntextpredictclassesxtestglove where you need to replace with the required arguments for your function it seems like maybe you had intended for buildmodelrnntext to be a class instead either way how exactly were you expecting this to work as you were not providing the required arguments wordindex embeddingsindex and nclasses
66337588,multilabel vs object detection,tensorflow deeplearning objectdetection imageclassification,since you dont need the object localization stick to classification only although you will be tempted to use the standard offtheshelf network of multiclass multilabel object detection because of its reusability but realize that you are asking the model to do more things if you have tons of data not a problem or if your objects are similar to the ones used in imagenetcoco etc you can simply use standard offtheshelf object detection architecture and finetune on your dataset however if you have less data and you need to train from scratch eg medical images weird objects then object detection will be an overkill and will give you inferior results remember most of the object detection networks recycle the classification architectures with modifications added to last layers to incorporate additional outputs for object detection coordinates there is a loss function associated with those additional outputs during training in order to get best loss value some of the classification accuracy is compromised for the sake of getting better object localization coordinates you dont need that compromise so you can modify the last layer of object detection network and remove the outputs for coordinates again all this hassle is worth only if you have less data and you really need to train from scratch
66282355,how to read the predicted label of a neural network with cross entropy loss,deeplearning neuralnetwork pytorch prediction multilabelclassification,first of all lets review the way you are calculating loss from your code you are using torchargmax function which expects targets size as torchsizenumsamples numclasses or torchsize in your case are you sure your training labels are compatible with this size from your writing i understand that you are reading label class as a number from to so its size is torchsize so when you are calling torchargmax with training data torchargmax is always returning thats why the model is learning to predict the class whatever the input is now as your class label for training is from to unfortunately if we use these labels with your lossfn or torchnncrossentropyloss it will be matched with total labels class to class as maximum class labels is so you need to transform to to for loss calculation use

66009779,in keras after you train a stateful lstm model do you have to retrain the model as you predict values,python tensorflow machinelearning keras deeplearning,for a stateful lstm if will retain information in its cells as you predict if you were to take any random point in the train or test dataset and repeatedly predict on it your answer will change each time because it keeps seeing this data and uses it every time it predicts the only way to get a repeatable answer would be to call resetstates you should be calling resetstates after each training epoch and when you save the model those cells should be empty then if you want to start predicting on the test set you can predict on the last n training points without saving the values anywhere then start saving values once you get to your first test point it is often good practice to seed the model before prediction if i want to evaluate on testset i can let the model predict on testset first to seed the model then start saving my predicted values once i get to the range i am interested in to address the further training question you do not need to train the model further to predict training will only be for tuning the models weights look into this blog for more information on stateful vs stateless lstm
65976622,can i use embedding layer instead of one hot as category input,machinelearning keras deeplearning prediction,yes you can use embeddings and that approach does work the attribute will not be equal to one element in the embedding but that combination of elements will equal to that attribute the size of the embedding is something that you will have to select yourself a good formula to follow is embeddingsize min m where m is the number of categories so if you have m you will have an embedding size of a higher embedding size means it will capture more details on the relationship between the categorical variables in my experience embeddings do help especially when you have s of categoriesif you have a small number of categories ie sex of a person then onehot encoding is sufficient within a certain category on which is better i find embeddings do perform better in general when there are s of unique values in a category why this is so i do not have any concrete reasons but some intuitions for it for example representing categories as dimensional dense vectorsword embeddings requires classifiers to learn far fewer weights than if the categories were represented as dimensional vectorsonehot encoding and the smaller parameter space possibly helps with generalization and avoiding overfitting

65897335,keras data generator predict same number of values,tensorflow keras deeplearning predict kerasrl,when you use a generator you specify a batch size modelpredict will produce batch size number of output predictions if you set steps that is all the predictions you will get to set the steps you should take the number of samples you have and divide it by the batch size for example if you have images with a batch size of then you should set steps equal to ideally you want to go through your test set exactly once the code below will determine the batch size and steps to do that in the code bmax is a value you select that limits the maximum batch size you should set this based on your memory size to avoid a oom out of memory error in the code below parameter length is equal to the number of test samples you have the result will be batchsize steps note if length is a prime number the result will be batchsize and stepslength
65882997,predict if probability is higher than certain value,tensorflow keras deeplearning neuralnetwork,softmax function outputs probabilities so in your case you will have classes and their probability sum will be equal to now consider a case which is the output of the softmax appyling a threshold in that case would not make sense as you can see threshold has nothing to do with nclassed predictions it is something special for binary classification for to get classes you should use argmax edit if you want to drop your predictions if they are under a certain threshold you can use but thats not a correct way to deal with multiclass predictions

65762961,why do sometimes cnn models predict just one class out of all others,python deeplearning pytorch convneuralnetwork,as ivan already noted you have a class imbalance problem this can be resolved via online hard negative mining at each iteration after computing the loss you can sort all elements in the batch belonging to no dr class and keep only the worst k then you estimate the gradient only using these worse k and discard all the rest see eg abhinav shrivastava abhinav gupta and ross girshick training regionbased object detectors with online hard example mining cvpr focal loss a modification for the vanilla cross entropy loss can be used to tackle class imbalance related posts this and this
65756787,keras d cnn always predicts the same result even if accuracy is high on training set,python keras deeplearning classification convneuralnetwork,also tried with sigmoid but the issue persists you dont want to be trying out activation functions or loss functions for a welldefined problem statement it seems you are mixing up a singlelabel multiclass and a multilabel multiclass architecture your output is a class multiclass output with softmax activation which is great but you use binarycrossentropy which would only make sense when used in a multiclass setting for multilabel problems you would want to use categoricalcrossentropy instead furthermore i would have suggested focal loss if there was class imbalance but it seems you have a class proportion so thats not necessary remember accuracy is decided based on which loss is being used check the different classes here when you use binarycrossentropy the accuracy used is binaryaccuracy while with categoricalcrossentropy it uses categoricalaccuracy check this chart for details on what to use in what type of problem statement other than that there is a bottleneck in your network at flatten and dense the number of trainable parameters is quite high relative to other layers i would advise using another cnn layer to bring the number of filters to say and the size of sequence even smaller and reduce the number of neurons for that dense layer as well of all of your trainable parameters reside between the flatten and dense layer not a great architectural choice outside the above points the model results are totally dependent on your data itself i wouldnt be able to help more without knowledge of the data
65711984,branched cnn classifier,tensorflow deeplearning convneuralnetwork,ok i can help you but i am still confused your testbatches are the same as your valid batches which are already partitioned into a b and c classes so why are you using them for test i would think you would have a separate directory for the test files if your model is an accurate classifier the predictions on the test set will be closely matched to the classification you made in creating the validation set yes there may be some differences due to classification errors and perhaps that is what you are looking to detect but ok see code below i did not test it but it should do what you want it will determine which test files were classified as classc then it stores those files to a directory you define then you can use the imagedatageneratorflowfromdirectory to provide the files as input to modelpredict
65627712,multinomialnb or gaussiannb or categoricalnb what to use here,machinelearning scikitlearn deeplearning naivebayes,each algorithm of nb expects different types of data gaussiannb when you have continuous features categoricalnb when you have categorical data multinomialnb applied to text data so given your data has continuous features categorical features and text data what algorithm you will use the fundamental assumption of each and every algorithm is that it assumes the features are conditionally independent fit the categorical features on categoricalnb continuous features on gaussiannb and text data on multinomialnb and get the likelihood probabilities of each modelfor each data point now we will have likelihood probabilities and multiply them to get the overall likelihood probability note you have to multiply the prior probability to the final likelihood probability to get the final posterior probability get more depth from here
65627620,custom small cnn has better accuracy than the pretrained classifiers,python deeplearning pytorch convneuralnetwork transferlearning,here is my theory pretraining is useful when you want to leverage already existing data to help the model train on similar data for which you have few instances at least this was the reasoning behind the unet architecture in medical now to me the key is in the notion of similar if your network have been pretrained on cats dogs and you want to extrapolate to weld seam theres a chance your pretraining is not helping or even getting in the way of the model training properly why when training your cnn you get randomly initialized weights whereas using a pretrained network you get pretrainned weights if the features your are extracting are similar across dataset then you get a head start by having the network already attuned to this features for example cats and dogs share similar spatial features visually eye position nose ears so theres chance that you converge to a local minima faster during training since your are already starting from a good base that just need to adapt to the new specific of your data conclusions if the similarity assumptions does not hold it means your model would have to unlearn what he already learned to adapt to the new specifics of your dataset and i guess that would be the reason why training is more difficult and does not give as good result as a blank slate cnn especially if you dont have that much data ps id be curious to see if your pre trained model end up catching up with your cnn if you give it more epochs to train
