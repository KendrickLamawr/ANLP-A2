79159805,how can i share a complex spacy nlp model across multiple python processes to minimize memory usage,nlp multiprocessing pythonmultiprocessing spacy,i would strongly advise you not to treat nlp models like any other python object i would always prefer to load an nlp model using a microservice approach which is more aligned with mlsoftware engineering best practices by separating the model logic from the main application instead of loading the model in each process which can be memoryintensive the model is loaded just once in a dedicated service this setup allows the model to be used by multiple parts of the application without duplicating memory usage making it efficient modular and scalable not only is your concern about memory efficiency addressed but scalability and modularity are also improved an example of implementing such a microservice using fastapi docker could look like this to containerize above fastapi service
79081924,with spacy how can i get all lemmas from a string,python pandas nlp spacy lemmatization,there are many ways to speed up spacy processing the question which of them make sense for you depends mostly on the size of your input the most obvious one is not individually apply the model to every single row but rather use batch processing use nlppipe with an iterable of strings this means it is easier to not use apply disable components that you do not use for token level processing where you need the lemmas this would be parser the dependency parser and ner the named entity recognition component increase the batchsize objects to buffer in pipe the default is obviously this only makes sense to touch if you have the memory to increase it a lot increase the number of processors used using nprocess this will increase the time it takes to initially load the model but decrease the processing time in my experience this starts making sense at about k texts note that this also requires the code to be run in an if name main wrapper basic example with and advanced example for all four

78865486,spacy matcher with optional suffix in pattern reports multiple matches on same text,nlp spacy matcher,i will say that the behavior youre observing with the spacy matcher is expected and it is not a bug when you use the text op pattern the op operator means that the colon is optional so the matcher will generate both the shorter and the longer match as youve seen explanation pattern text mylabel text op text mylabel some value so for this pattern spacy will try to match mylabel alone because the colon is optional mylabel because the colon can be included therefore you will get two matches mylabel and mylabel now to answer your questions is this the intended behavior or is it a bug this is intended behavior the op operator allows the colon to be optionally matched leading to multiple matches how should i determine that the second match really is just a subset of the first match to determine if one match is a subset of another you can compare the start and end indices of the matches the longer match will have the same start index but a different end index now i wrote a code below even using spacy version see details below now example in code import spacy from spacymatcher import matcher nlp spacyloadencorewebsm doc nlpmylabel some value matcher matchernlpvocab pattern text mylabel text op matcheraddr pattern matches matcherdoc for matchid start end in matches span docstartend printfmatch spantext start start end end now we determine if one match is a subset of another matchessortkeylambda x x x sort by start index then by end index descending filteredmatches lastend for matchid start end in matches if start lastend this is for avoiding adding subsets filteredmatchesappendmatchid start end lastend end for matchid start end in filteredmatches span docstartend printffiltered match spantext now this code will filter out the shorter match and your output will be now will the shorter match always be reported before the longer match i dont think the matches are not guaranteed to be reported in a specific order so to handle this you can sort the matches by their start and end indices as shown in the code example abovenow after sorting you can now filter out matches that are subsets of longer matches another alternative solution if you want to ensure that only the longest match is returned you can change the way you define the pattern pattern text mylabel text op greedy longest note that the greedy flag doesnt change the behavior of matching itself but rather can influence how overlaps are handled in certain custom settings now back to the summary of what i explained the behavior youre seeing is by design due to the optional op operator in addition you can filter out the shorter match by comparing start and end indices of the matches furthermore sorting the matches by start and end indices allows you to keep only the longest nonoverlapping matches

74494620,spacy doccharspan raises error whenever there is any number in string,python json nlp spacy spacy,the error typeerror object of type nonetype has no len occurs in line docents ents when one of the entries in ents is none the reason for having a none in the list is that doccharspanstart end label returns none when the start and end provided dont align with token boundaries the tokenizer of the model spacyblanken doesnt behave as needed for this use case it seems that it doesnt produce an end of token after a comma that follows a number without space after the comma examples tokenizing a number with decimals import spacy nlp spacyblanken nlptokenizerexplain token one single token tokenizing a number comma letter nlptokenizerexplaina token a one single token tokenizing a letter comma letter nlptokenizerexplainaa token a infix token a three tokens tokenizing a number comma space letter nlptokenizerexplain a token suffix token a three tokens tokenizing a number comma space number nlptokenizerexplain token suffix token three tokens therefore with the default tokenizer a space is needed after a comma following a number so the comma is used to create the token boundaries workarounds preprocess your text to add a space after the commas you desire to split tokens by this would also require to update the start and end values of the annotations create your custom tokenizer as described in spacy documentation

74181750,a checklist for spacy optimization,optimization nlp spacy microoptimization,checklist the following checklist is focused on runtime performance optimization and not training ie when one utilises existing configcfg files loaded with the convenience wrapper spacyload instead of training their own models and creating a new configcfg file however most of the points still apply this list is not comprehensive the spacy library is extensive and there are many ways to build pipelines and carry out tasks thus including all cases here is impractical regardless this list intends to be a handy reference and starting point summary if more powerful hardware is available use it use optimally small modelspipelines use your gpu if possible process large texts as a stream and buffer them in batches use multiprocessing if appropriate use only necessary pipeline components save and load progress to avoid recomputation if more powerful hardware is available use it cpu most of spacys work at runtime is going to be using cpu instructions to allocate memory assign values to memory and perform computations which in terms of speed will be cpu bound not ram hence performance is predominantly dependent on the cpu so opting for a better cpu as opposed to more ram is the smarter choice in most situations as a general rule newer cpus with higher frequencies more coresthreads more cache etc will realise faster spacy processing times however simply comparing these numbers between different cpu architectures is not useful instead look at benchmarks like cpuuserbenchmarkcom eg ik vs ryzen x and compare the singlecore and multicore performance of prospective cpus to find those that will likely offer better performance see footnote on hyperthreading corethread counts ram the practical consideration for ram is the size larger texts require more memory capacity speed and latency is less important if you have limited ram capacity disable ner and parser when creating your doc for large input text eg doc nlpmy really long text disable ner parser if you require these parts of the pipeline youll only be able to process approximately availableramingb characters at a time if you dont youll be able to process more than this note that the default spacy input text limit is characters however this can be changed by setting nlpmaxlength yourdesiredlength gpu if you opt to use a gpu processing times can be improved for certain aspects of the pipeline which make use of gpubased computations see the section below on making use of your gpu the same general rule as with cpus applies here too generally newer gpus with higher frequencies more memory larger memory bus widths bigger bandwidth etc will realise faster spacy processing times overclocking if youre experienced with overclocking and have the correct hardware to be able to do it adequate power supply cooling motherboard chipset then another effective way to gain extra performance without changing hardware is to overclock your cpugpu use optimally small modelspipelines when computation resources are limited andor accuracy is less of a concern eg when experimenting or testing ideas load spacy pipelines that are efficiency focused ie those with smaller models for example load a smaller pipeline for faster processing nlp spacyloadencorewebsm load a larger pipeline for more accuracy nlp spacyloadencorewebtrf as a concrete example of the differences on the same system the smaller encoreweblg pipeline is able to process words per second whereas the encorewebtrf pipeline only processes remember that there is often a tradeoff between speed and accuracy use your gpu if possible due to the nature of neural networkbased models their computations can be efficiently solved using a gpu leading to boosts in processing times for instance the encoreweblg pipeline can process vs words per second when using a cpu vs a gpu spacy can be installed for a cuda compatible gpu ie nvidia gpus by calling pip install u spacycuda in the command prompt once a gpuenabled spacy installation is present one can call spacyprefergpu or spacyrequiregpu somewhere in your program before any pipelines have been loaded note that requiregpu will raise an error if no gpu is available for example spacyprefergpu or use spacyrequiregpu nlp spacyloadencorewebsm process large texts as a stream and buffer them in batches when processing large volumes of text the statistical models are usually more efficient if you let them work on batches of texts default is and process the texts as a stream using nlppipe for example texts one document lots of documents nlp spacyloadencorewebsm docs listnlppipetexts batchsize use multiprocessing if appropriate to make use of multiple cpu cores spacy includes builtin support for multiprocessing with nlppipe using the nprocess option for example texts one document lots of documents nlp spacyloadencorewebsm docs listnlppipetexts nprocess note that each process requires its own memory this means that every time a new process is spawned the default start method model data has to be copied into memory for every individual process hence the larger the model the more overhead to spawn a process therefore it is recommended that if you are just doing small tasks that you increase the batch size and use fewer processes for example texts one document lots of documents nlp spacyloadencorewebsm docs listnlppipetexts nprocess batchsize default batchsize finally multiprocessing is generally not recommended on gpus because ram is limited use only necessary pipeline components generating predictions from models in the pipeline that you dont require unnecessarily degrades performance one can prevent this by either disabling or excluding specific components either when loading a pipeline ie with spacyload or during processing ie with nlppipe if you have limited memory exclude the components you dont need for example load the pipeline without the entity recognizer nlp spacyloadencorewebsm excludener if you might need a particular component later in your program but still want to improve processing speed for tasks that dont require those components in the interim use disable for example load the tagger but dont enable it nlp spacyloadencorewebsm disabletagger perform some tasks with the pipeline that dont require the tagger eventually enable the tagger nlpenablepipetagger note that the lemmatizer depends on taggerattributeruler or morphologizer for a number of languages if you disable any of these components youll see lemmatizer warnings unless the lemmatizer is also disabled save and load progress to avoid recomputation if one has been modifying the pipeline or vocabulary made updates to model components processed documents etc there is merit in saving ones progress to reload at a later date this requires one to translate the contentsstructure of an object into a format that can be saved a process known as serialization serializing the pipeline nlp spacyloadencorewebsm some changes to pipeline save serialized pipeline nlptodiskenmypipeline load serialized pipeline nlpfromdiskenmypipeline serializing multiple doc objects the docbin class provides an easy method for serializingdeserializing multiple doc objects which is also more efficient than calling doctobytes on every doc object for example from spacytokens import docbin texts one document lots of documents nlp spacyloadencorewebsm docs listnlppipetexts docbin docbindocsdocs save the serialized docbin to a file docbintodiskdataspacy load a serialized docbin from a file docbin docbinfromdiskdataspacy footnotes hyperthreading is a term trademarked by intel used to refer to their proprietary simultaneous multithreading smt implementation that improves parallelisation of computations ie doing multiple tasks at once amd has smt as well it just doesnt have a fancy name in short processors with way smt smt allow an operating system os to treat each physical core on the processor as two cores referred to as virtual cores processors with smt will perform better on tasks that can make use of these multiple cores sometimes referred to as threads eg the ryzen x is an core thread processor ie physical cores but with smt it has virtual cores or threads note that intel has recently released a cpu architecture with ecores which are cores that dont have hyperthreading despite other cores on the processor namely pcores having it hence you will see some chips like the ik that have cores with hyperthreading but it has threads not this is because only the pcores have hyperthreading while the ecores do not hence threads total

71722637,spacy matcher restricting potential matches,nlp spacy textparsing matcher dependencyparsing,okay friends i found the answer here are two solutions if you know the beginning and end rules for your span as well as its token length you can use the notin function within the matcher to accept all possible tokens except ones you choose to prohibit the below matcher defines the beginning end and middle tokens the beginning and end should be clear the middle token can be anything other than the dep tag pos etc you define in this case we want to match any single token except a nsubj and punct this pattern matches an sconj in the first token matches any token that is not an nsubj or pucnt in the second token and matches any verb in the third token but what if there are an invariable number of tokens between your desired beginning and end token in order to accept indefinitely long matches while specifying the beginning and end tokens we combine the op and notin functions we modify the above code as follows this pattern matches an sconj in the first token matches an indefinite string of tokens so long as they are not nsubj or punct and matches any verb in the third token the op tells the matcher to accept any token the notin specifies a list of tokens that should be exempt from the aforementioned rule if one of these specified tokens does exist within the pattern the matcher will not match the span best of luck everyone

71280615,spacy adds words automatically to vocab,python pythonx nlp spacy,the spacy vocab is mainly an internal implementation detail to interface with a memoryefficient method of storing strings it is definitely not a list of real words or any other thing that you are likely to find useful the main thing a vocab stores by default is strings that are used internally such as pos and dependency labels in pipelines with vectors words in the vectors are also included you can read more about the implementation details here all words an nlp object has seen need storage for their strings and so will be present in the vocab thats what youre seeing with your nonsense string in the example above
71269432,how to load data for only certain label of spacys ner entities,python nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,it isnt possible to do this the ner model is classifying each tokenspan between all the labels it knows about and the knowledge is not separable additionally the ner component requires a tokvec depending on the pipeline architecture you may be able to disable the toplevel tokvec edit i incorrectly stated the toplevel tokvec was required for the small english model it is not see here for details it may be possible to train a smaller model that only recognizes gpes with similar accuracy but i wouldnt be too optimistic about it it also wouldnt be faster

70863919,get wrong noun chunks using spacy docnounchunks,python nlp dependencies spacy,the differences are probably due to using a different version of encorewebtrf theres a new model release for each minor spacy release so there are model versions v v v you can see the currently installed model versions with spacy validate if you need the exact same annotation for a particular task specify the exact model version in your requirements i think that youre seeing differences due to updates in the v model that improve the pos tags which are mapped with rules from the finegrained tags and dependency parse some noun chunk errors come from taggerparser errors but this looks like the right tag parse and pos here exact definitions of noun chunk can vary but in the examples i can find mainly from the conll shared task relative pronouns like this are included as noun chunks

70530322,creating training data into a trainspacy file from manually tagged data with custom entity labels,python nlp spacy,it looks like it should be trivial to put your data in iobner format which spacy can convert directly see here the format is a little like this since spacy requires training labels to be in this format that is not correct that format is often used for demonstration purposes but in v the only requirement is that training data be saved as annotated doc objects
70492407,bilou tagging scheme for multiword entities in spacys ner,python nlp namedentityrecognition spacy,the tagging you have is correct while all outside words which are not entities would be marked with o the model will be depending on the same order within the entity to match it towards a previous entity of the same name ex and will not be linked as the same entity although if you want this to be the case you could look into a classification model to classify your foud entities towards your previously known entities and work from there

69976538,spacy preparing training data doccharspan returning none,python nlp spacy namedentityrecognition spacy,as the other answers have pointed out you have an encoding issue that you need to resolve we cant say what encoding your file is without seeing it normally on linux you can use the file command to check encoding not perfect but pretty good but json is supposed to always be utf so that wont help here if you have access to the prejson data source you might want to check that however besides that the issue is that charspan returns none if your span is invalid that is if your character indices dont align with token boundaries for example if you wanted to mark tokyo in the tokyo tower is example but gave character indices and toky youd get none in this case it sounds like you have a systematic error that needs fixing but if a small number of annotations are bad there are options you can pass to the function to tell it to expand or contract if the alignment is off instead check the docs for more details
69883942,rename spacys pos tagger labels,python nlp spacy spacy,this is not possible the pos attribute specifically only holds universal dependency tags and will give an error if you try to set another value you can set any value in the tag attribute if you want though its designed for language specific finegrained tags which have more detail than ud tags i am not really sure why you would want to do this instead of just getting used to the real tags and i suspect that trying to change this will cause you a lot of headaches for little benefit like redefining keywords in a programming language that said the easiest way to do this is probably to define a custom token extension call it mypos that translates the real tags to your tags that would look a little like this

68573795,using spacy to extract tensor by token id,python nlp spacy transformermodel spacy,unfortunately this is not possible the problem is that transformer models generate their embeddings for individual tokens on the context meaning if you have he same tokenid in two different sentences they will likely have a significantly different embedding the only way is to return the tensor associated with each of the tokens but you cannot generate them solely based on the inputids

67777505,memoryerror with fastapi and spacy,nlp spacy fastapi uvicorn,the spacy tokenizer seems to cache each token in a map internally consequently each new token increases the size of that map over time more and more new tokens inevitably occur although with decreasing speed following zipfs law at some point after having processed large numbers of texts the token map will thus outgrow the available memory with a large amount of available memory of course this can be delayed for a very long time the solution i have chosen is to store the spacy model in a ttlcache and to reload it every hour emptying the token map this adds some extra computational cost for reloading the spacy model but that is almost negligible
67717406,how to use spacy nlp custom ner to identity types of docs at once,python nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,the description of your data is a little vague but given these assumptions you dont know if a document is type a or type b you need to classify it the ner is completely different between type a and b documents what you should do is use up to three separate spacy pipelines use the first pipeline with a textcat model to classify docs into a and b types and then have one pipeline for ner for type a docs and one pipeline for type b docs after classification just pass the text to the appropriate ner pipeline this is not the most efficient possible pipeline but its very easy to set up you just train three separate models and stick them together with a little glue code you could also train the models separately and combine them in one spacy pipeline with some kind of special component to make execution of the ner conditional but that would be pretty tricky to set up so id recommend the separate pipelines approach first that said depending on your problem its possible that you dont need two ner models and learning entities for both types of docs would be effective so i would also recommend you try putting all your training data together training just one ner model and seeing how it goes if that works then you can have a single pipeline with textcat and ner models that dont directly interact with each other to respond to the comment when i say pipeline i mean a language object which is what spacyload returns so you train models using the config and each of those is in a directory and then you do this

66762169,for integerdates values annotated using prodigy does the spacy model learn the range of values as well,nlp spacy namedentityrecognition prodigy,good question spacy does not internally represent numeric tokens as numbers so it doesnt have an explicit concept of the values in that sense it cant tell between valid and invalid values for age however spacy does use shape features when representing tokens that will help it recognize valid ages there are different kinds of shape tokens but the one spacy uses will represent words by converting characters to a representation of the character type it works like this spacy xxxxx fish xxxx fish xxxx dd dddd ddd because of this you could expect that spacy learns that twodigit numbers are likely to be ages but numbers with decimals or four digits arent likely on the other hand this doesnt help it differentiate between and for dates this will not help with determining valid or invalid birthdates shape is just one of spacys features but other features like prefix and suffix arent really going to help with this either since its easy to verify numeric values in code what i would suggest is matching broadly in spacy and then using your own function to check whether dates or ages are valid by parsing them outside of spacy in particular the question of how nlp models represent numeric values is actually an increasingly popular research topic if youd like to know more about it this is a recent article on the topic do language models know how heavy an elephant is

64055526,extract main and subclauses from german sentence with spacy,python nlp spacy,the problem can be divided into two tasks splitting the sentence in its constituting clauses and identifying which of the clauses is a main clause and which one is a subclause since there are pretty strict grammatical rules about the structure difference of subclauses and main clauses i would go with a rulebased approach split sentence into clauses a clause contains a finite verb in german subclauses are separated by comma from the reigning clause they depend on either a main clause or another subclause main clauses are separated from other main clauses either by comma or by one of the conjunctions und oder aber and sondern if two main clauses are connected by und or oder the comma is omitted thats why the idea could possibly come to our mind to split the sentence into chunks by comma and undoderabersondern but this leaves us with the problem that such things as commaseparated parts which are not a clause exist think of enumerations or of appositions as well as und and oder do not always denote the beginning of a new clause think of enumerations also we could face situations where the comma at the beginning of a subclause has been omitted even if this is against the normative grammatical rules of german we still would want to identify these subclauses correctly thats why it is a better idea to start from the finite verbs in the sentence and make use of spacys dependency parser we may assume that each finite verb is part of its own subclause so we can start from a finite verb and walk through its progeny its children and their children and so on this walk needs to stop as soon as it encounters another finite verb because this will be the root of another clause we then just need to combine the path of this walk into one phrase this needs to take into account that a clause can consist of multiple spans because a clause can be divided by a subclause consider relative clauses which relate to an object in the main clause identify whether a clause is main clause or subclause grammatically in german subclauses can be identified by the fact that the finite verb is in the last position which is impossible in main clauses so we can make use of spacys partofspeechtags to solve the problem we can differentiate the different tags of verbs whether the verb form is finite or infinite and we can easily check if the last token in the clause before the punctuation is a finite or infinite verb form code import itertools as it import typing as tp import spacy verbpos verb aux finiteverbtags vvfin vmfin vafin class clause def initself spans tpiterablespacytokensspan clause is a sequence of potentially divided spans this class basically identifies a clause as subclause and

sub nicht erneut fr den vorsitz ihrer partei kandidiert sub obwohl sie stets der auffassung war sub kanzlerschaft und parteivorsitz wrden sub in eine hand gehren this is wrong correct would be the error is caused by spacy misidentifying kandidiert as finite verb while it is a participle and also misidentifying gehren as a finite verb form while it is an infinite verb since this error is based in the underlying language model provided by spacy it seems hard to correct this outpout independently from the language model however maybe there could be a rulebased way to override spacys decision to tag these verb forms as infinite verbs i didnt find a solution yet

61486629,problem adding custom entities to spacys ner,nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,in principle the way youre trying to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem by retraining it on its old predictions seems like a good approach to me however if you are having duplicate versions of the same sentence but annotated differently and feeding that to the ner classifier you may confuse the model the reason is that it doesnt just look at the positive examples but also explicitely sees nonannotated words as negative cases so if you have bob lives in london and you only annotate london then it will think bob is surely not an ne if then you have a second sentence where you annotate only bob it will unlearn that london is an ne because now its not annotated as such so consistency really is important i would suggest to implement a more advanced algorithm to resolve the conflicts one option is to always just take the annotated entity with the longest span but if the spans are often exactly the same you may need to reconsider your label scheme which entities collide most often i would assume org and orgname do you really need org perhaps the two can be merged as the same entity

59021227,with spacy how to make sure a sequence of letters is never split into tokens,python nlp tokenize spacy,spacys current handling of special cases that contain characters that are otherwise prefixes or suffixes isnt ideal and isnt quite what youd expect in all cases this would be a bit easier to answer with examples of what the text looks like and where the tokenization isnt working but if is always surrounded by whitespace a special case should work if should be tokenized as if it is a word like to one option is remove and from the prefixes and suffixes and then those characters arent treated any differently from t or o adjacent punctuation would be split off as affixes adjacent lettersnumbers wouldnt be if is potentially adjacent to any other characters like a or aa or its probably easiest to add it as a prefix suffix and infix adding it before the default patterns so that the default patterns like arent matched first this is a good case for using the new debugging function that was just added the tokenizer disclaimer i am the author with spacy v try the output prefix suffix tells you which patterns are responsible for the resulting tokenization as you modify the patterns this function should let you see more easily whether your modifications are working as intended after the modifications in the final example above the output is
59017699,in spacy how can i make sure a particular character is always considered a full token,python nlp tokenize spacy,see here spacys tokenizer works by iterating over whitespaceseparated substrings and looking for things like for prefixes or suffixes to separate those parts off you can add custom prefixes and suffixes as explained in the link above we can use that as follows

58887601,spacy matcher unable to identitfy the pattern besides the first,python nlp spacy,spacys matcher operates over tokens single spaces in the sentence do not yield tokens also there are different characters which resemble hyphens dashes minus signs etc one has to be careful about that the following code works
58876392,what is the difference between token and span a slice from a doc in spacy,python nlp token spacy,token vs span from spacys documentation a token represents a single word punctuation symbol whitespace etc from a document while a span is a slice from the document in other words a span is an ordered sequence of tokens why spans spacys matcher gives a spanlevel information rather than tokenlevel because it allows a sequence of tokens to be matched in the same way that a span can be composed of just token this isnt necessarily the case consider the following example where we match for the token hello on its own the token world on its own and the span composed of the tokens hello world import spacy nlp spacyloaden from spacymatcher import matcher matcher matchernlpvocab matcheradd none lower hello matcheradd none lower world matcheradd none lower hello lower world for hello world all of these patterns match document nlphello world tokenidx token for token in document hello world matcherdocument however the rd pattern doesnt match for hello world since hello world arent contiguous tokens because of the token so they dont form a span document nlphello world tokenidx token for token in document hello world matcherdocument accessing tokens from spans despite this you should be able to get tokenlevel information from the span by iterating over the span the same way you could iterate over tokens in a doc document nlphello world span typespan hello world tokenidx token typetoken for token in span hello world

58642793,spacy model inconsistent prediction,python nlp spacy,there are several problems with your approach ill point some and you can research deeper dataset size sentences is too small for a machine learning based approach what spacy does is it trains a machine learning model that takes into account word pos and surrounding words pos vectors etc this in turn requires a lot of examples for the algorithm to properly infer some of the informations your data is not natural language what i mean is that you have structured data and you want to generalize from it natural language models learn from the context surrounding words and you are providing a unnatural structured context to all training samples you wont be able to generalize from this since your samples are not general enought in summary gather more diverse data
58615367,why is spacy failing at tokenizing a particular quotation mark,python nlp spacy,the issue isnt the tokenization which should always split off in this case but the ner which uses a statistical model and doesnt always make perfect predictions i dont think youve shown all your code here but from the output i would assume youve merged entities by adding mergeentities to the pipeline these are the resulting tokens after entities are merged and if an entity wasnt predicted correctly youll get slightly incorrect tokens i tried the most recent encoreweblg and couldnt replicate these ner results but the models for each version of spacy have slightly different results if you havent try v which uses some data augmentation techniques to improve the handling of quotes

58381909,spacy issue in finding root word in sentence using dependency parsing,nlp spacy,it should first be noted that the root is not necessarily a verb see here and here the root is the one node that is not dominated by one of the other nodes nonfinite clauses contain a verb which does not show tense for example the person to win the competition in this example it is pretty clear that the root is person and win is a dependent of person in the same way if we have the company to acquire jagged peak energy in an allstock deal it would also be clear that the root is company your first example parsley energy to acquire jagged peak energy in an allstock deal is less obvious i think it is an ellipsis the omitted word in the elliptical sentence being is the sentence would normally be parsley energy is to acquire see here if the main predicate is not present due to ellipsis and there are multiple orphaned dependents one of these is promoted to the head root position and the other orphans are attached to it to conclude it does not appear that spacy is making an error here
58363886,spacy how to write named entities to an existing doc object using some loaded model for this,python nlp token spacy namedentityrecognition,you can get the ner component from your loaded model and call it directly on the constructed doc you can inspect a list of all the available components in the pipeline with nlppipenames and call them individually this way the tokenizer is always the first element of the pipeline when you call nlp and it isnt included in this list which only has the components that both take and return a doc
58296163,spacy ner differentiating numbers or entities,machinelearning nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,these tasks go beyond what you would expect an ner model to be able to do in a number of ways spacys ner algorithm could be used to find types of entities like money which is an entity type in its english models or maybe something like symptom but it doesnt look at a very large context to detectclassify entities so its not going to be able to differentiate these cases where the relevant context is fairly far away you probably want to combine ner or another type of relevant span detection which could also be rulebased with another type of analysis that focuses more on the context this could be some kind of text classification you could examine the dependency parse etc here is a simple example from the spacy docs about extracting entity relations using ner to find money followed by examining the dependency parse to try to figure out what the money element could be referring to
58251398,how to detect sentence stress by python nlp packages spacy or nltk,nlp nltk stanfordnlp spacy,i dont think that nltk or spacy support this directly you can find content words with either tool sure but thats only part of the picture you want to look for software related to prosody or intonation which you might find as a component of a texttospeech system heres a very recently published research paper with code that might be a good place to start the annotated data and the references could be useful even if the code might not be exactly the kind of approach youre looking for

58210582,nlp named entity recognition using nltk and spacy,pythonx nlp nltk spacy namedentityrecognition,spacy models are statistical so the named entities that these models recognize are dependent on the data sets that these models were trained on according to spacy documentation a named entity is a realworld object thats assigned a name for example a person a country a product or a book title for example the name zoni is not common so the model doesnt recognize the name as being a named entity person if i change the name zoni to william in your sentence spacy recognize william as a person one would assume that pencil eraser and sharpener are objects so they would potentially be classified as products because spacy documentation states objects are products but that does not seem to be the case with the objects in your sentence i also noted that if no named entities are found in the input text then the output will be empty
58197863,how to get sentence number in spacy,python nlp spacy,theres no builtin sentence index but you can iterate over sentences you can use custom extensions to save the sentence index on spans or tokens if you need to store it for use elsewhere

57890739,train spacy ner model with encorewebsm as base model,machinelearning nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,short answer yes if you want to keep your model precise long answer ner is implemented using machine learning algorithms these classify a token as a entity based on learned distributions and surrounding tokens therefore if you provide several samples of annotated text without marking a word token as a specific entity that it usually represents you may affect your model precision by providing samples to your model where that token is unimportant
57886043,spacy ner can a same word be part of two different entities,nlp stanfordnlp spacy featureextraction namedentityrecognition,from the documentation the entity recognizer is constrained to predict only nonoverlapping nonnested spans the training data should obey the same constraint if you like you could have two sentences with the different annotations in your data im not sure whether this would hurt or help your performance though if you want spacy to learn to recover both annotations you could have two entityrecognizer instances in the pipeline you would need to move the entity annotations into an extension attribute because you dont want the second entity recogniser to overwrite the entities set by the first one consequence if you want to have a single ner tagger you must label as follows entities brand nestle product cookie if you want to train two separate ner taggers one for brand and one for product then you can do entities brand nestle product nestle cookie

57511442,how to train custom ner in spacy with single words data set,nlp spacy,spacy ner model training includes the extraction of other implicit features such as pos and surrounding words when you attempt to train on single words it is unable to get generalized enought features to detect those entities take for instance this example extracted from spacys own training tutorial how could the ner model correctly guess what kind of entity the word google refers in that context if not by the surroundings the same goes for your words ner is not a regexlike function but rather a machine learning model
57494201,spacy generate generic sentences and then train the model on top of that is it a good idea,nlp entity spacy namedentityextraction,this approach is called augmenting training data with synthetic data it can definitely be a very useful technique when your training data is limited however in my experience it should be used carefully or with moderation otherwise you run the risk of overfitting your model to the training data in other words your model might have difficulty generalizing beyond the entities in your food list because it has seen those so many times during training and it comes to expect those also as you mentioned overfitting may arise through through repeated sentence structures this synthetic permutation data should be as generated as randomly as possible one can use the sample method in the python random library for each sentence in the initial training data set draw a small sample of foods from your list and for each of the sampled foods substitute that food in the sentence to produce a new sentence a slightly different approach which can perhaps generalize better over unseen food entities is instead of using the food list from your training sentences is to download a list of foods and use that lists of foods can be found on github for example here or here or extracted from wikipedia here in both cases using a sample size of n produces an nfold increase in training data

57415016,how to prepare data for spacys custom named entity recognition,pythonx nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,no spacy will need exact start end indices for your entity strings since the string by itself may not always be uniquely identified and resolved in the source text examples apple is usually an org but can be a person ann is a person but not in annotation tools are best for this purpose in python you can use the re module to grab the indices you will have to go through and verify the indices before creating your spacy training set
57370524,meaning of drop in spacy custom ner model training,python nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,according to the documentation here the spacy entity recognizer is a neural network that should implement the thincneuralmodel api the drop argument that you are talking about is something called dropout rate which is a way to optimize a neural network the recommended value is based on my experience which means that about of the neurons used in this model will be dropped randomly during training

56841777,python spacy look for chunks backwards before a reference,python nlp grammar spacy chunks,you can analyze the whole document and then just find the noun chunk before each reference either by token position or character offset the token offset of the last token in a noun chunk is nounchunki and the character offset of the start of the last token is nounchunkidx check that the analysis isnt affected by the presence of the reference strings your example style references seem to be analyzed as appositives which is fine if the analysis is affected by the reference strings remove them from the document while keeping track of their character offsets analyze the whole document and then find the noun chunks preceding the saved positions
56837440,python spacy looking for two or more words in a window,python nlp spacy matcher,for a window with k words where k is relatively small you can add k optional wildcard tokens between your words wildcard means any symbol and in spacy terms it is just an empty dict optional means the token may be there or may not and in spacy in is encoded as op thus you can write your matcher as which means you look for hello then to tokens of any kind then world for example for it will print you and if you want to match the other order world hello as well you need to add the second symmetric pattern into your matcher
56822056,unnormalized result of word movers distance with spacy,python nlp spacy,a short answer dont interpret it use it just like this the lower is the distance the more similar are sentences for virtually all practical applications eg knn this is enough now the long answer word mover distance read the paper is defined as the weighted average of distances between best matching pairs of nonstop words so if you want to normalize it into you need to divide this best sum by its worst case the problem is that in spacy word vectors are not normalized check it by printing sumtvector for t in doc therefore the maximal distance between them is unlimited and if you do normalize them the new wmd will not be equivalent to original wmd ie it will sort pairs of texts differently therefore there is no obvious way to normalize the original spacywmd distances that you demonstrated now lets pretend that word vectors are unitnormalized if it is the case then the maximal distance between two words is the diameter of a unit sphere that is and the maximal weighted average of many s is still so you need to divide the distance between texts by to make it fully normalized you can build word vector normalization into wmd calculation by inheriting the class you use now you can be sure that your distance is properly normalized now the result is ps you can see that even between two very unrelated texts this normalized distance is much less than this is because in reality word vectors dont cover the whole unit sphere instead most of them are clustered on several continents on it therefore the distance even between very different texts would be typically less than
56808822,spacy is a mining,python nlp spacy,i think you need some syntactic analysis here from syntactic point of view your sentences look like i used the method from this question to plot the trees now instead of extracting substrings you should extract subtrees a minimal code to achieve this would first find is a pattern and then yield the left and the right subtrees if they are attached to the is a with a right sort of dependencies it would output something like so you at least separate the left part from the right part correctly if you want you can add more filters eg that lpos propn another improvement would be to handle cases with more then children of is eg adverbs now you can prune the subtrees as you like producing even smaller predicates like large cat comic cat strip cat cat that lives in ohio etc a quickanddirty version of such pruning could look every time at only one child it would produce the following result you see that some subtrees are wrong cape town is not the oldest city globally but it seems that you need at least some semantic knowledge to filter out such incorrect subtrees

56298584,access spacy masked language model,python nlp spacy languagemodel,this is basically the disadvantage of the lmao approximation i actually hadnt realised this until it was pointed out to me by someone on the rmachinelearning subreddit because were predicting a vector we really only get to predict one point in the vectorspace this is really different from predicting a distribution over the words imagine we had a gap like the of corn lets say a good distribution of fillers for that would be kernel ear piece the vectors for these words arent especially close as the wordvec algorithm is constructing a vector space based on all contexts of the words and the words are only interchangeable in this context in the vast majority of uses of piece the word ear would be a really bad substitution if the likely fillers arent close together in the vectorspace there will be no way for the lmao model to return you an answer that corresponds to that set of words if you only need the best answer the algorithm in spacy pretrain has a good chance of giving it to you but if you need the distribution the approximation breaks down and you should use something like bert

55241927,spacy intraword hyphens how to treat them one word,nlp tokenize spacy,note to see the custom tokenizer that keeps the hyphenated words see the botton of the answer here a custom tokenizer is defined that tokenizes text into tokens using a set of builtin nlpdefaultsprefixes and custom patterns the nlpdefaultsprefixes r r r is tuple concatenation operation the result looks like as you see these are all regular expressions and are used to process inword punctuation infixes see the spacy tokenizer algorithm the algorithm can be summarized as follows iterate over spaceseparated substrings check whether we have an explicitly defined rule for this substring if we do use it otherwise try to consume a prefix if we consumed a prefix go back to the beginning of the loop so that specialcases always get priority if we didnt consume a prefix try to consume a suffix if we cant consume a prefix or suffix look for infixes stuff like hyphens etc once we cant consume any more of the string handle it as a single token now when we are at infix handling step these regular expressions are used to split text into tokens based also on these patterns eg is important because if you do not add it abcdefghi will be a single token but with the pattern added it will be split into abc def ghi the that is the same as matches a and wants to match right after but since it is not there the is skipped and no split occurs you get the whole marketingrepresentative token note however if you have marketingrepresentative in the sentence and you use regex you will get marketing representative as a result as there will be a match the regex matches any char any char a dot matches any char in regex so the rule just tokenizes splits out these tokens out of the sentence eg nt rd etc answer to edit you should be very careful when adding new rules and check if they do not overlap with already added ones eg when you add rbsb to split out genetive case apostrophes you should override the rule from nlpdefaultsprefixes either remove it if you do not plan to match as infix or give priority to your custom rules by appendng the nlpdefaultsprefixes to those rules not vice versa see a sample code output that is yahya s laptopcover details rsb matches s that are followed with a word boundary r matches a that is not preceded or followed with a digit and if you want to use a custom tokenizer that keeps hyphenated letter words as single tokens you will have to redefine the infixes the r line accounts for that and you need to get rid of it since it is the only item that contains a string it will be easier to drop this item from the infixes and recompile the infix pattern

52557058,spacy nlp pipeline order of operations,python nlp spacy lemmatization,the answer to your question is more complicated than i originally thought but now i will explain it in detail spacy lemmatization usually is performed based on a lookup table that means that is independent on the pipeline components and it lemmatization happens before the pipe however english language and greek language are designed such that a rule based lemmatization can be performed when pos tag is available that means that if tagger is enabled then we can take advantage of the pos tag in order to find the best lemma matching the word based on its tag in this case lemmatization happens just after the tagger pipeline component briefly if tagger is disabled the we follow a static lemmatization procedure based on a lookup table that matches words to their lemmas and lemmatization happens before any pipeline component contrary to that when tagger is enabled the lemmatization procedure is rule based and dependent on the pos tag so it happens after tagger i repeat that this case can happen only for certain languages that support rule based lemmatization such as english and greek language a code example output with line commented out those be random word output with line without comment that be random word hope it is clarified now

52341628,whats the point of downloading models when using spacy,nlp spacy,the spacy guide has a section on this see here while some of spacys features work independently others require statistical models to be loaded which enable spacy to predict linguistic annotations for example whether a word is a verb or a noun spacy currently offers statistical models for languages which can be installed as individual python modules models can differ in size speed memory usage accuracy and the data they include the model you choose always depends on your use case and the texts youre working with for a generalpurpose use case the small default models are always a good start they typically include the following components binary weights for the partofspeech tagger dependency parser and named entity recognizer to predict those annotations in context lexical entries in the vocabulary ie words and their contextindependent attributes like the shape or spelling word vectors ie multidimensional meaning representations of words that let you determine how similar they are to each other configuration options like the language and processing pipeline settings to put spacy in the correct state when you load in the model
52293874,why does spacy not preserve intrawordhyphens during tokenization like stanford corenlp does,pythonx nlp spacy,although not documented at spacey usage site it looks like that we just need to add regex for fix we are working with in this case infix also it appears we can extend nlpdefaultsprefixes with custom regex this will give you desired result there is no need set default to prefix and suffix since we are not working with those result you may want to fix addon regex to make it more robust for other kind of tokens that are close to the applied regex

52201919,custom normalisation for spacy,nlp spacy,answering my own question i ended up writing a custom tokenizer that makes sure that all n characters are separate tokens the same for spaces since vectorization algorithm is not clear and see it like a black box we ended up writing our own vectorization we didnt use spacy native vectors
52113939,spacy strange similarity between two sentences,python nlp spacy,spacy constructs sentence embedding by averaging the word embeddings since in an ordinary sentence there are a lot of meaningless words called stop words you get poor results you can remove them like this or only keep nouns since they have the most information
52098228,spacys rulebased matcher finds tokens longer than specified by the shape,nlp spacy,i found a workaround that solves my problem but doesnt really explain why spacy behaves the way it does i will leave the question open use shape and additionally specify length explicitly please note that the online explorer seems to fails when length is used no tokens are highlighted it is working fine on my machine

51766157,how to force a pos tag in spacy beforeafter tagger,python nlp spacy,edit this solution used spacy iirc to answer the second part of your question you can add special tokenisation rules to the tokeniser as stated in the docs here the following code should do what you want assuming those symbols are unambiguous output for this is the tags are not correct but this shows the special case rules have been applied as for the first part of your question the problem with assigning a partofspeech to individual words is that they are mostly ambiguous out of context eg return noun or verb so the above method would not allow you to account for use in context and is likely to generate errors spacy does allow you to do tokenbased pattern matching however so that is worth having a look at maybe there is a way to do what youre after
51739273,spacy verb highlight,nlp spacy,you can use displacy ent interface to highlight custom entities by setting manualtrue on either render or serve here is a simple example additionally to obtain data in required format you could do a dependency parsing and use phrasematcher over it to get start and end values
51725599,training sentence tokenizer in spacy,nlp nltk tokenize textprocessing spacy,spacy is a little unusual in that the default sentence segmentation comes from the dependency parser so you cant train a sentence boundary detector directly as such but you can add your own custom component to the pipeline or preinsert some boundaries that the parser will respect see their documentation with examples spacy sentence segmentation for the cases youre describing it would potentially be useful also be able to specify that a particular position is not a sentence boundary but as far as i can tell thats not currently possible
51686456,spacy thinc crashing django on heroku,python django pip nlp spacy,i resolved this issue but am leaving the answer in case someone else needs it the problem was that my thread was taking too long to respond because of how and when i was building and training my sklearn models as a result heroku aborted the thread which is why the stack trace shows abort the fix was to change how and when i was loading the ml models so this particular operation didnt timeout

51648046,difference or relation between rasa and spacy,python nlp spacy rasanlu rasacore,the rasa stack has two primary components nlu and core inside of rasa nlu there are pipelines for extracting intents and entities one of the pipeline components uses spacy for example in this rasa pipeline spacy is used for preprocessing of the utterances tokenization and featurization it also utilizes other python libraries like nltk and sklearn but rasa nlu has several different pipeline options so in the below pipeline spacy is not used at all but sklearn and tensorflow are rasa nlu attempts to abstract some of the difficulties of working with spacy and other libraries to make it easier and more focused on building a chatbot then there are other applications that are trying to take rasa nlu and make it even easier to use by providing a more abstraction with a gui its a fairly common pattern in open source where one tool builds on another some of the gui applications for rasa are rasa x this is a part of rasas enterprise solution rasa ui rasa talk articulate
51412095,spacy save custom pipeline,python nlp spacy,when you save out your model spacy will serialize all data and store a reference to your pipeline in the models metajson for example ner countries when you load your model back in spacy will check out the meta and initialise each pipeline component by looking it up in the socalled factories functions that tell spacy how to construct a pipeline component the reason for that is that you usually dont want your model to store and eval arbitrary code when you load it back in at least not by default in your case spacy is trying to look up the component name countries in the factories and fails because its not builtin the languagefactories are a simple dictionary though so you can customise it and add your own entries a factory is a function that receives the shared nlp object and optional keyword arguments config parameters it then initialises the component and returns it if you add the above code before you load your model it should load as expected more advanced approaches if you want this taken care of automatically you could also ship your component with your model this requires wrapping it as a python package using the spacy package command which creates all required python files by default the initpy only includes a function to load your model but you can also add custom functions to it or use it to add entries to spacys factories as of v currently available as a nightly version for testing spacy will also support providing pipeline component factories via python entry points this is especially useful for production setups andor if you want to modularise your individual components and split them into their own packages for example you could create a python package for your countries component and its factory upload it to pypi version it and test it separately in its setuppy your package can define the spacy factories it exposes and where to find them spacy will be able to detect them automatically all you need to do is install the package in the same environment your model package could even require your component package as a dependency so its installed automatically when you install your model

51259007,dependency parsing using spacy,python parsing nlp dependencies,first of all setting the compact flag in displacy will reduce the size of tree shown but only this wont work for large paragraphs what ill suggest is instead of viewing the dependency parse of the whole paragraph break the paragraph into sentences first then parse each sentence and view them you can save the parse trees of each sentence as a svg file and then see them one by one here is the code for saving svg alternatively you can save the whole parse tree of the paragraph as svg and open it in a browser then you can easily view it with zoom and scroll
51252914,finding whether or not a word is on the dependency path of two entities with spacy,python nlp spacy partofspeech dependencyparsing,so my solution was found using that post there is an answer dedicated to spacy my implementation for finding the dependency path between two words in a given sentence output what it actually does is to first build a nonoriented graph for the sentence where words are the nodes and dependencies between words are the edges and then find the shortest path between two nodes for my needs i just then check for each word if its on the dependency path shortest path generated
51087661,spacy matcher end token offset not what i am expecting,python nlp matcher spacy,i think the problem is that youre only looking at the start and end token instead of the matched span the end index of a span is always exclusive so doc will be token up to token i just tried your example and printed each matched spans text and im seeing the following output to answer your second question you could use the custom extension attributes like tokennegated and tokennegation to achieve something very similar if your negation rule matches you could create a span for the match iterate over the tokens and set the respective attributes to make this more elegant you can also wrap that logic in a pipeline component so its run automatically when you call nlp on a text

50752266,spacy tokenize quoted string,pythonx nlp spacy,while you could modify the tokenizer and add your own custom prefix suffix and infix rules that exclude quotes im not sure this is the best solution here for your use case it might make more sense to add a component to your pipeline that merges certain quoted strings into one token before the tagger parser and entity recognizer are called to accomplish this you can use the rulebased matcher and find combinations of tokens surrounded by the following pattern looks for one or more alphanumeric characters heres a visual example of the pattern in the interactive matcher demo to do the merging you can then set up the matcher add the pattern and write a function that takes a doc object extracts the matched spans and merges them into one token by calling their merge method for a more elegant solution you can also refactor the component as a reusable class that sets up the matcher in its init method see the docs for examples if you add the component first in the pipeline all other components like the tagger parser and entity recognizer will only get to see the retokenized doc thats also why you might want to write more specific patterns that only merge certain quoted strings you care about in your example the new token boundaries improve the predictions but i can also think of many other cases where they dont especially if the quoted string is longer and contains a significant part of the sentence
50743734,nlp spacy strategy for improving document similarity,nlp similarity spacy,you can do most of that with spacy and some regexes so you have to take a look at the spacy api documentation basic steps in any nlp pipeline are the following language detection self explanatory if youre working with some dataset you know what the language is and you can adapt your pipeline to that when you know a language you have to download a correct models from spacy the instructions are here lets use english for this example in your command line just type python m spacy download en and then import it to the preprocessing script like this tokenization this is the process of splitting the text into words its not enough to just do textsplit ex theres would be treated as a single word but its actually two words there and is so here we use tokenizers in spacy you can do something like where text is your dataset corpus or a sample from a dataset you can read more about the document instance here punctuation removal pretty self explanatory process done by the method in the previous step to remove punctuation just type pos tagging short for partofspeech tagging it is the process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech for example where the uppercase codes after the slash are a standard word tags a list of tags can be found here in spacy this is already done by putting the text into nlp instance you can get the tags with morphological processing lemmatization its a process of transforming the words into a linguistically valid base form called the lemma in spacy its also already done for you by putting the text into nlp instance you can get the lemma of every word by removing stopwords stopwords are the words that are not bringing any new information or meaning to the sentence and can be omitted you guessed its also already done for you by nlp instance to filter the stopwords just type now you have a clean dataset you can now use wordvec or glove pretrained models to create a word vectors and input your data to some model alternatively you can use tfidf for creating the word vectors by removing the most common words also contrary to the usual process you may want to leave the most specific words as your task is to better differentiate between two texts i hope this is clear enough
50742516,how to get the index of a token in a sentence in spacy,nlp spacy dependencyparsing,a spacy doc object also lets you iterate over the docsents which are span objects of the individual sentence to get a spans start and end index in the parent document you can look at the start and end attribute so if you iterate over the sentences and subtract the sentence start index from the tokeni you get the tokens relative index within the sentence the default sentence segmentation uses the dependency parse which is usually more accurate however you can also plug in a rulebased or entirely custom solution see here for details

50504108,unable to download spacy model,pythonx nlp python spacy,the problem might be related to this issue and pr and the fact that unlike requests urllib doesnt check for certificates in extra places after some back and forth the upcoming version of spacy will revert this change and go back to using requests dropping the dependency just wasnt worth the hassle in the meantime you can always download and install the models manually by pointing pip install to the direct url see this section in the docs for details
50330455,how to detokenize spacy text without doc context,nlp spacy,internally spacy keeps track of a boolean array to tell whether the tokens have trailing whitespace you need this array to put the string back together if youre using a seqseq model you could predict the spaces separately james bradbury author of torchtext was complaining to me about exactly this hes right that i didnt think about seqseq models when i designed the tokenization system in spacy he developed revtok to solve his problem basically what revtok does if i understand correctly is pack two extra bits onto the lexeme ids whether the lexeme has an affinity for a preceding space and whether it has an affinity for a following space spaces are inserted between tokens whose lexemes both have space affinity heres the code to find these bits for a spacy doc def hasprespacetoken if tokeni return false if tokennborwhitespace return true else return false def hasspacetoken return tokenwhitespace the trick is that you drop a space when either the current lexeme says no trailing space or the next lexeme says no leading space this means you can decide which of those two lexemes to blame for the lack of the space using frequency statistics jamess point is that this strategy adds very little entropy to the word prediction decision alternate schemes will expand the lexicon with entries like hello or hello his approach does neither because you can code the string hello as either hello or as hello this choice is easy we should definitely blame the period for the lack of the space
50207313,spacy not assigning proper dependency label when parsing text,python machinelearning nlp spacy,i think the origin of your problem is that the root of the dependency tree is automatically labelled as root and the root of the dependency tree is defined as the token whose head is itself a possible workaround consists in adding an artificial root to your training data also add the symbol root to your test examples texts root how do i delete my account with these changes if you train the model long enough you will obtain

50152856,spacy create new language model with data from corpus,python windows nlp spacy,there are three main components of a language model in spacy the static languagespecific data shipped in python tokenizer exceptions stop words rules for mapping finegrained to coarsegrained partofspeech tags the statistical model trained to predict partofspeech tags dependencies and named entities trained on a large labelled corpus and included as binary weights and optional word vectors that can be converted and added before or after training you can also train your own vectors on your raw text using a library like gensim and then add them to spacy spacy vx allows you to train all pipeline components independently or in on go so you can train the tagger parser and entity recognizer on your data all of this requires labelled data if youre training a new language from scratch you normally use an existing treebank heres an example of the universal dependencies corpus for spanish which is also the one that was used to train spacys spanish model you can then convert the data to spacys json format and use the spacy train command to train a model for example i dont know whats in your corpustxt and whether its fully labelled or only raw text i also dont know of any existing resources for luxembourgish sounds like thats potentially quite hard to find if your data is labelled you can convert it to spacys format using one of the builtin converters or your own little script if your corpus consists of only raw text you need to label it first and see if its suitable to train a general language model ultimately this comes down to experimenting but here are some strategies label your entire corpus manually for each component eg partofspeech tags if you want to train the tagger dependency labels if you want to train the parser and entity spans if you want to train the entity recognizer youll need a lot of data though ideally a corpus of a similar size to the universal dependencies ones experiment with teaching an existing pretrained model luxembourgish for example the german model this might sound strange but its not an uncommon strategy instead of training from scratch you posttrain the existing model with examples of luxembourgish ideally until its predictions on your luxembourgish text are good enough you can also create more training data by running the german model over your luxembourgish text and extracting and correcting its mistakes see here for details remember that you always need evaluation data too also referred to as development data in the docs this is usually a random portion of your labelled data that you hold back during training and use to determine whether your model is improving
50068013,is spacy language independent when training ner,python nlp spacy,spacy uses a pipeline consist of a tokenizer tagger parser and an entity recognizer it means every level outputs just be fed to next level as input so for example if i use en tokenizer for fr tagger no error will happen but tokenzier exceptions and norm exceptions in en language will affect my fr doc so maybe accuracy will decrease

49493232,how to add custom slangs into spacys normexceptionspy module,nlp spacy,the norm exceptions are part of the language data and the attribute getter the function that takes a text and returns the norm is initialised with the language class eg english you can see an example of this here this all happens before the pipeline is even constructed the assumption here is that the norm exceptions are usually languagespecific and should thus be defined in the language data independent of the processing pipeline norms are also lexical attributes so their getters live on the underlying lexeme the contextinsensitive entry in the vocabulary as opposed to a token which is the word in context however the nice thing about the tokennorm is that its writeable so you can easily add a custom pipeline component that looks up the tokens text in your own dictionary and overwrites the norm if necessary keep in mind that the norm attribute is also used as a feature in the model so depending on the norms you want to add or overwrite you might want to only apply your custom component after the tagger parser or entity recognizer is called for example by default spacy normalises all currency symbols to to ensure that they all receive similar representations even if one of them is less frequent in the training data if your custom component now overwrites with euro this will also have an impact on the models predictions so you might see less accurate predictions for money entities if youre planning on training your own model that takes your custom norms into account you might want to consider implementing a custom language subclass alternatively if you think that the slang terms you want to add should be included in spacy by default you can always submit a pull request for example to the english normexceptionspy
49492038,spacy training multithread cpu usage,python multithreading nlp spacy,the only things that are multithreaded are the matrix multiplications which in v are done via numpy which delegates them to a blas library everything else is singlethreaded you should check what blas library your numpy is linked to and also make sure that the library has been compiled appropriately for your machine on my machine the numpy i install via pip comes with a copy of openblas that thinks my machine has a prescott cpu this prevents it from using avx instructions so if i install default numpy from pip on my machine it runs x slower than it should another problem is that openblas might be launching more threads than it should this seems especially common in containers finally the efficiency of parallelism very much depends on batchsize on small batches the matrices are small and the perupdate routines such as the adam optimiser take more of the time i usually disable multithreading and train on a single core because this is the most efficient in the sense of dollarsforwork i then have more models training as separate processes usually on separate gce vms when writing spacy i havent assumed that the goal is to use lots of cores the goal is efficiency its not a virtue to use your whole machine to perform the same work that could be done on a single core a lot of papers are very misleading in this respect for instance it might feel satisfying to launch training processes across a cloud and optimize using an asynchronous sgd strategy such as hogwild this is an efficient way to burn up a bunch of energy but doesnt necessarily train your models any faster using adam and smaller batch sizes training is more stable and often reaches the same accuracy in many fewer iterations similarly we can make the network larger so the machines get their workoutbut why the goal is to train the model multiplying a bunch of matrices is a means not an end the problem ive been most concerned with is the terrible blas linkage situation this will be much improved in v as well be bringing our own openblas kernel the kernel will be singlethreaded by default a simple thing to try if you suspect your blas is bad is to try installing numpy using conda that will give you a copy linked against intels mkl library

49306083,spacy doesnt recognize money and countries as expected,python nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,according to spacy documentation of spanish model it supports identification of per loc org and misc entities it is trained on ancora and wikiner corpus in the release note it was mentioned that because the model is trained on wikipedia it may perform inconsistently on many genres such as social media text as the results for your data are not satisfactory you need train it for your data this can be done as suggested in here for money you can actually write a simple regular expression like this for american dollar money
49274650,directly load spacy model from packaged targz file,python model nlp load spacy,no thats currently not possible the main purpose of the targz archives is to make them easy to install via pip install however you can always extract the model data from the archive and then load it in from a path see here for more details using the spacy link command you can also create shortcut links for your models ie symlinks that let you load in models using a custom name instead of the full path or package name this is especially useful if youre working with large models and multiple environments and dont want to install the data in each of them the above shortcut link would then let you load your model like this alternatively if you really need to load models from an archive you could always write a simple wrapper for spacyload that takes the file extracts the contents reads the model meta gets the path to the data directory and then calls spacyutilloadmodelfrompath on it and returns the nlp object

49097804,spacy entity from phrasematcher only,nlp spacy,i think you might want to implement something similar to this example ie a custom pipeline component that uses the phrasematcher and assigns entities spacys builtin entity recognizer is also just a pipeline component so you can remove it from the pipeline and add your custom component instead your entity matcher component could then look something like this when your component is initialised it creates match patterns for your terms and adds them to the phrase matcher my example assumes that you have a list of terms and a label you want to assign for those terms when you call nlp on a string of text spacy will tokenize text text to create a doc object and call the individual pipeline components on the doc in order your custom components call method then finds matches in the document creates a span for each of them which allows you to assign a custom label and finally adds them to the docents property and returns the doc you can structure your pipeline component however you like for example you could extend it to load in your terminology list from a file or make it add multiple rules for different labels to the phrasematcher
48980120,is it possible to parse emojis using spacy,python nlp emoji spacy,yes spacy actually includes a pretty comprehensive list of textbased emoticons as part of its tokenizer exceptions so using your example above and printing the individual tokens the emoticon is tokenized correctly i think what happens here is that you actually came across an interesting maybe nonideal edge case with the displacy defaults to avoid very long dependency arcs for punctuation the collapsepunct setting defaults to true this means that when the visualisation is rendered punctuation is merged onto the preceding token punctuation is identified by checking whether the tokens ispunct attribute returns true which also happens to be the case for in your example you can work around this by setting collapsepunct to false in the options passed to displacyserve the displacy visualizer should probably include an exception for emoticons when merging punctuation this is currently difficult because spacy doesnt have an isemoji or issymbol flag however it might be a nice addition in the future you can vote for it on this thread
48970035,why doesnt spacy given any children to the root node,python nlp spacy,i think the problem here is quite simple getting the root of the sentence and its children requires the dependency parse this means that you need to have a model loaded that includes weights to predict the dependencies in your code youre only importing the english language class which only includes languagespecific rules and tokenizer you can download the default small english model like this or any of the other options you can then use spacyload to load in the model under the hood this tells spacy to find the model installed as en check its meta data to initialise the respective language class english construct the processing pipeline parser tagger ner and make the weights available to enable spacy to make predictions since the default sentence boundary detector uses the dependency parse it will be included already so theres no need to add it to the pipeline manually just tested your example and it now prints a list of the roots children

48443624,custom sentence boundary detection in spacy,python nlp spacy,ines from spacy answered my question here thanks for bringing this up and sorry this is a little confusing im pretty sure the first problem you describe is already fixed on master spacy should definitely respect custom sentence boundaries even in pipelines with no dependency parser if you want to use your custom sbd component without a parser a very simple solution would be to set docisparsed true in your custom component so when docsents checks for the dependency parse it looks at isparsed and wont complain if you want to use your component with the parser make sure to add it before the parser the parser should always respect already set sentence boundaries from previous processing steps
48313907,what does the spacy phrasematcher match on,python nlp spacy,the phrasematcher will match on the orth value ie the exact text this lets it match large terminology lists and exact occurrences of strings without having to worry about spacys tokenization for more background on this why the phrasematcher cant work on other attributes and possible solutions for caseinsensitivity see this discussion on the issue tracker if you want to match based on token attributes youll probably want to use the rulebased matcher instead theres also this newly added example in the docs that shows how to use the matcher with token match patterns and regular expressions or binary flags more generally this can be useful to add your own custom token descriptions like different spellings you might also want to check out spacylookup a community plugin that uses the flashtext module and provides an alternative to the builtin phrasematcher
48199353,how to use spacy in large dataset with short sentences efficiently,python nlp spacy,you can use multithreading in spacy to create a fast tokenization and data ingestion pipeline rewriting your code block and functionality using the nlppipe method would look something like this this way puts all your filtering into the tokenfilter function which takes in a spacy token and returns true only if it is not punctuation a space a stopword and or less characters then you use this function as you pass through each token in each document where it will return the lemma only if it meets all of those conditions then filteredtokens is a list of your tokenized documents some helpful references for customizing this pipeline would be token attributes languagepipe

48143769,spacy nlp library what is maximum reasonable document size,python nlp spacy,spacy has a maxlength limit of characters i was able to parse a document with words just fine the limit can be raised i would split the text into n chunks depending upon total size the vx parser and ner models require roughly gb of temporary memory per characters in the input this means long texts may cause memory allocation errors if youre not using the parser or ner its probably safe to increase the nlpmaxlength limit the limit is in number of characters so you can check whether your inputs are too long by checking lentext

47983900,get fully formed word text from word root lemma and partofspeech pos tags in spacy,python nlp spacy,as far as i know spacy doesnt currently have that functionality built in however it would be fairly easy to set up custom token attributes that would do something similar to what youre asking for example if you wanted to define a pasttense conjugation attribute for all the verb tokens you could create a vbd function and apply it as a getter on each token as a custom attribute as follows as you can see the function isnt very robust as it spits out beed and buyed but looked is correct as for a robust way to do do the conjugation pattern is the best library ive encountered if you replace the vbd function with the correct conjugation function plus define functions for whatever other conjugations or inflections you want youd be pretty close to what youre imagining this would allow you to use pattern only for the conjugation but tokenize and lemmatize with spacy
47638877,using phrasematcher in spacy to find multiple match types,python nlp spacy,spacys phrasematcher supports adding multiple rules containing several patterns and assigning ids to each matcher rule you add if two rules overlap both matches will be returned so you could do something like this when you call the matcher on your doc spacy will return a list of matchid start end tuples because spacy stores all strings as integers the matchid you get back will be an integer too but you can always get the string representation by looking it up in the vocabularys stringstore ie nlpvocabstrings when you add matcher rules you can also define an onmatch callback function as the second argument of matcheradd this is often useful if you want to trigger specific actions for example do one thing if a color match is found and something else for a product match if you want to solve this even more elegantly you might also want to look into combining your matcher with a custom pipeline component or custom attributes for example you could write a simple component thats run automatically when you call nlp on your text finds the matches and sets a doccontainsproduct or tokeniscolor attribute the docs have a few examples of this that should help you get started
47633449,how to get better lemmas from spacy,python nlp wordnet spacy lemmatization,i think it would help answer your question by clarifying some common nlp tasks lemmatization is the process of finding the canonical word given different inflections of the word for example run runs ran and running are forms of the same lexeme run if you were to lemmatize run runs and ran the output would be run in your example sentence note how it lemmatizes means to mean given that it doesnt sound like the task you want to perform is lemmatization it may help to solidify this idea with a silly counterexample what are the different inflections of a hypothetical lemma pm pming pmed pms none of those are actual words it sounds like your task may be closer to named entity recognition ner which you could also do in spacy to iterate through the detected entities in a parsed document you can use the ents attribute as follows with the sentence youve given spacy v doesnt detect any entities if you replace pm with pm it will detect that as an entity but as a gpe the best thing to do depends on your task but if you want your desired classification of the pm entity id look at setting entity annotations if you want to pull out every mention of pm from a big corpus of documents use the matcher in a pipeline

47523112,detect stopword after lemma in spacy,python nlp spacy stopwords lemmatization,stop words in spacy are just a set of strings which set a flag on the lexemes the contextindependent entries in the vocabulary see here for the english stop list the flag simply checks whether text in stopwords which is why something returns true for isstop and somethings doesnt however what you can do is check if the tokens lemma or lowercase form is part of the stop list which is available via nlpdefaultsstopwords ie the defaults of the language youre using if youre using spacy v and want to solve this even more elegantly you could also implement your own isstop function via a custom token attribute extension you can choose any name for your attribute and it will become available via token for example tokenisstop

47231027,spacy matcher add takes at least positional arguments given,python nlp spacy,this is indeed strange and i wasnt able to reproduce the error using your example on spacy v it worked perfectly fine for me so the easiest explanation is that somehow your script is actually executing the wrong spacy spacy vx also had a matcheradd method which took positional arguments so this would fit the error executing the wrong spacy can happen if you previously had spacy vx installed and its still on your pythonpath in a different environment system python etc it could also be that you installed spacy but forgot to tell pip to upgrade ie by running pip install u spacy the easiest way to find out is to add the following line at the top of your file btw if it turns out you need to reinstall or upgrade to the new version dont forget to download the new models as well
47219639,spacy ner training,nlp trainingdata namedentityrecognition spacy,yes you can still create goldparse objects with the biluo tags the main reason the usage examples show the simpler offset format is that it makes them slightly easier to read and understand if you only want to train the ner you can now also use the nlpdisablepipes context manager and disable all other pipeline components eg the tagger and parser during training after the block the components will be restored so when you save out the model it will include the whole pipeline you can see this in action in the ner training examples
47053698,spacy japanese tokenizer,python nlp spacy cjk,according to spacy tokenization for japanese language using spacy is still in alpha phase the ideal way for tokenization is to provide tokenized word list with information pertaining to language structure also for example for a english language sentence you can try this such results are currently not available for japanese language if you use python m spacy download xx and use nlp spacyloadxx it tries best to understand named entities also if you look at the source for spacy at here you will see that tokenization is available but it brings forth only a makedoc function which is quite naive note the pip version of spacy is still old code the above link for github still has a bit to latest code so for building a tokenization it is highly suggested as of now to use janome an example for this is given below i think spacy team is working on similar output to build models for japanese language so that language specific constructs could be made for japanese also similar to the ones for other languages update after writing out of curiosity i started to search around please check udpipe here here here it seems udpipe supports more than languages and it provides solution to problem we see in spacy as far as language support is concerned
46826541,methods for creating training data for spacy models,nlp trainingdata spacy,im one of the maintainers of spacy and weve actually been thinking about this problem a lot so weve built prodigy an annotation tool that integrates with spacy and puts the model in the loop to help you train and evaluate models faster its currently in beta but you can sign up for a free invite prodigy takes a slightly different approach to the clickdraghighlightselect concept of other annotation tools it uses the model in the loop to suggest annotations with the most relevant gradient for training and only asks you for a simple binary feedback accept or reject this lets you move through examples quickly as you annotate the model in the loop is updated and its predictions will influence what prodigy asks next this works especially well if youre looking to improve existing entity types present in your spacy model or if youre working with a large corpus of example text you want to use for annotation if youre looking for a tool more specifically for highlighting and annotating spans of text you should also check out brat im not sure what the output looks like but you should definitely be able to convert it to spacys training format theres also a trainable version of the displacy ent visualizer developed by someone from the community

46377054,spacy what is normpart of tokenizerexceptions,python nlp tokenize spacy,to answer the question more generally in spacy vx the norm is mostly used to supply a normalised form of a token for example the full inflected form if the token text is incomplete like in the gonna example or an alternate spelling the main purpose of the norm in vx is making it accessible as the norm attribute for future reference however in vx currently in alpha the norm attribute becomes more relevant as its also used as a feature in the model this lets you normalise words with different spellings to one common spelling and ensures that those words receive similar representations even if one of them is less frequent in your training data examples of this are american vs british spelling in english or the currency symbols which are all normalised to to make this easier v introduces a new language data component the norm exceptions if youre working on your own language models id definitely recommend checking out v alpha which is pretty close to a first release candidate now
46348209,how is spacys similarity computed,python machinelearning nlp wordvec spacy,assuming that the method you are referring to is the token similarity one you can find the function in the sourcecode here as you can see it computes the cosine similarity between the vectors as it says in the tutorial a word embedding is a representation of a word and by extension a whole language corpus in a vector or other form of numerical mapping this allows words to be treated numerically with word similarity represented as spatial difference in the dimensions of the word embedding mapping so the vector distance can be related to the word similarity

44395656,applying spacy parser to pandas dataframe w multiprocessing,python nlp multiprocessing spacy,spacy is highly optimised and does the multiprocessing for you as a result i think your best bet is to take the data out of the dataframe and pass it to the spacy pipeline as a list rather than trying to use apply directly you then need to the collate the results of the parse and put this back into the dataframe so in your example you could use something like this approach will work fine on small datasets but it eats up your memory so not great if you want to process huge amounts of text

43795249,how does spacy lemmatizer works,python nlp wordnet spacy lemmatization,lets start with the class definition class it starts off with initializing variables now looking at the selfexc for english we see that it points to where its loading files from the directory why dont spacy just read a file most probably because declaring the string incode is faster that streaming strings through io where does these index exceptions and rules come from looking at it closely they all seem to come from the original princeton wordnet rules looking at it even closer the rules on is similar to the morphy rules from nltk and these rules originally comes from the morphy software additionally spacy had included some punctuation rules that isnt from princeton morphy exceptions as for the exceptions they were stored in the irregpy files in spacy and they look like they also come from the princeton wordnet it is evident if we look at some mirror of the original wordnet exc exclusion files eg and if you download the wordnet package from nltk we see that its the same list index if we look at the spacy lemmatizers index we see that it also comes from wordnet eg and the redistributed copy of wordnet in nltk on the basis that the dictionary exceptions and rules that spacy lemmatizer uses is largely from princeton wordnet and their morphy software we can move on to see the actual implementation of how spacy applies the rules using the index and exceptions we go back to the the main action comes from the function rather than the lemmatizer class why is the lemmatize method outside of the lemmatizer class that im not exactly sure but perhaps its to ensure that the lemmatization function can be called outside of a class instance but given that staticmethod and classmethod exist perhaps there are other considerations as to why the function and class has been decoupled morphy vs spacy comparing spacy lemmatize function against the morphy function in nltk which originally comes from created more than a decade ago morphy the main processes in oliver steeles python port of the wordnet morphy are check the exception lists apply rules once to the input to get y y y etc return all that are in the database and check the original too if there are no matches keep applying rules until we find a match return an empty list if we cant find anything for spacy possibly its still under development given the todo at line but the general process seems to be look for the exceptions get them if the lemma from the exception list if the word is in it apply the rules save the ones that are in the index lists if there are no lemma from step then just keep track of the outofvocabulary words oov and also append the original string to the lemma forms return the lemma forms in terms of oov handling spacy returns the original string if no lemmatized form is found in that respect the nltk implementation of morphy does the sameeg checking for infinitive before lemmatization possibly another point of difference is how morphy and spacy decides what pos to assign to the word in that respect spacy puts some linguistics rule in the lemmatizer to decide whether a word is the base form and skips the lemmatization entirely if the word is already in the infinitive form isbaseform this will save quite a bit if lemmatization was to be done for all words in the corpus and quite a chunk of it are infinitives already the lemma form but thats possible in spacy because it allowed the lemmatizer to access the pos thats tied closely to some morphological rules while for morphy although its possible to figure out some morphology using the finegrained ptb pos tags it still takes some effort to sort them out to know which forms are infinitive generalment the primary signals of morphology features needs to be teased out in the pos tag person number gender updated spacy did make changes to their lemmatizer after the initial answer may i think the purpose was to make the lemmatization faster without lookups and rules processing so they prelemmatize words and leave them in a lookup hashtable to make the retrieval o for words that they have prelemmatized also in efforts to unify the lemmatizers across languages the lemmatizer is now located at but the underlying lemmatization steps discussed above is still relevant to the current spacy version dddddcbcbfbcddcebfc epilogue i guess now that we know it works with linguistics rules and all the other question is are there any non rulebased methods for lemmatization but before even answering the question before what exactly is a lemma might the better question to ask

34102420,pos tagging using spacy,python nlp spacy,tldr you should accept the occasional error details spacys tagger is statistical meaning that the tags you get are its best estimate based on the data it was shown during training i would guess those data did not contain the word dosa the tagger had to guess and guessed wrong there isnt an easy way to correct its output because it is not using rules or anything you can modify easily the model has been trained on a standard corpus of english which may be quite different to the kind of language you are using it for domain if error rate is too high for your purposes you can retrain the model using domainspecific data this will be very laborious though ask yourself what you are trying to achieve and whether error rate in pos tagging is the worst of your problems in general you shouldnt judge the performance of a statistical system on a casebycase basis the accuracy of modern english pos taggers is around which is roughly the same as the average human you will inevitably get some errors however the errors of the model will not be the same as the human errors as the two have learnt how to solve the problem in a different way sometimes the model will get confused by things you and i consider obvious eg your example this doesnt mean it is bad overall or that pos tagging is your real problem

57884850,difference between spacy models sm md lg,spacy languagemodel,so if all models were trained on the same dataset ontonotes and the only difference is the vectors why then is there a performance difference for the tasks that dont require vectors i think the missing piece youre looking for is this one if models are initialised with vectors those vectors will be used as features during training depending on the vectors this can give the statistical model components you train a significant boost in accuracy however vectors can be quite large so you typically want to find the best tradeoff between model size and accuracy if vectors were used during training the same vectors also need to be available at runtime and you cant easily swap them out otherwise the model will perform much worse the sm model which wasnt trained with vectors allows you to load in your own vectors for say similarity comparisons without affecting the predictions of the pretrained statistical components tldr spacys sm md and lg core models were all trained on the same data under the same conditions the only difference is the vectors that are included which are used as features and thus have an impact on the models accuracy

60970109,remove training data from spacy model,python spacy textclassification,you mean to revert specific cases as far as i know thats not currently possible in spacy i would suggest to either retrain from scratch with the corrected annotations or continue training with the updated annotations if you continue training make sure that you keep feeding a representative set to your model so that it doesnt forget cases it was already predicting correctly before
60888020,difference between blank and pretrained models in spacy,python spacy textclassification,if you are using spacys text classifier then it is fine to start with a blank model the textcategorizer doesnt use features from any other pipeline components if youre using spacy to preprocess data for another text classifier then you would need to decide which components make sense for your task the pretrained models load a tagger parser and ner model by default the lemmatizer which isnt implemented as a separate component is the most complicated part of this it tries to provide the best results with the available data and models if you dont have the package spacylookupsdata installed and you create a blank model youll get the lowercase form as a defaultdummy lemma if you have the package spacylookupsdata installed and you create a blank model it will automatically load lookup lemmas if theyre available for that language if you load a provided model and the pipeline includes a tagger the lemmatizer switches to a better rulebase lemmatizer if one is available in spacy for that language currently greek english french norwegian bokml dutch swedish the provided models also always include the lookup data for that language so they can be used when the tagger isnt run if you want to get the lookup lemmas from a provided model you can see them by loading the model without the tagger import spacy nlp spacyloadencorewebsm disabletagger in general the lookup lemma quality is not great theres no information to help with ambiguous cases and the rulebased lemmas will be a lot better however it does take additional time to run the tagger so you can choose lookup lemmas to speed things up if the quality is good enough for your task and if youre not using the parser or ner model for preprocessing you can speed things up by disabling them nlp spacyloadencorewebsm disablener parser

79292283,attaching custom kb to spacy entitylinker pipe makes ner calls very poor,spacy namedentityrecognition entitylinking knowledgebasepopulation,what happens here is that this line actually reinitializes all trained components in your pipeline it sets all weights back to random initializations effectively producing garbage as you saw from the ner results you do need to initialize the new entitylinker component however you can do so by calling it on the component directly the latter will require an additional getexamples parameter which might be a small hassle alternatively you can disable the pipes that should be kept as is in a context manager when making the call on the nlp object you can read more about this mechanism in the usage docs and in the api docs by the way all of this should happen automagically when you use the config system in spacy v and set the frozen components correctly cf you would have something like this for the config route you can take inspiration from this example project hope that resolves things for you

74224813,how to train several ner models spacy,python spacy spacy,when you use a model as a source of vectors or for that matter a source for any other part of a pipeline spacy will not modify it under any circumstances something else is going on are you perhaps using a different virtualenv does spacyloadencoreweblg work one thing that could be happening but seems less likely is that in some fields you can use the name of an installed pipeline using entry points or a local path if you have a directory named encoreweblg where you are training that could be checked first
74070201,spacy isdigit or likenum not working as expected for certain chars,spacy,it may be helpful to just check which tokens are true for likenum like this here youll see that sometimes the tokens you have are split in two and sometimes they arent the tokens you match are only the ones that consist just of digits now why are m g and t split off while h j and v arent this is because they are units as for mega giga or terabytes this behaviour with units may seem inconsistent and weird but its been chosen to be consistent with the training data used for the english models if you need to change it for your application look at this section in the docs which covers customizing the exceptions
74060732,create api with flask that receives strings and returns the similarity between them with spacy,python api flask spacy similarity,you are trying to reach the url however within your code there is no route defined for this path thus the error is returned you need a route that accepts both a get and a post request to both display a form and receive data from a submitted form sent via post otherwise a error is returned because the request method is not allowed approute methodget post def index if requestmethod post handle a post request and the data sent here within flask it is not possible to request input with input as mentioned above you need a form within an html page within this form you can define input fields that must be provided with a name attribute in order to query them on the server side if the submit button is now pressed the data of the form as defined in the method attribute is sent to the server via post and can be queried here the input fields are queried using the name attribute finally the endpoint must have a return value in your case this is the template that displays the page with the form and outputs the possible result approute methodsget post def index if requestmethod post x requestformgetx y reutestformgety return rendertemplateindexhtml so the entire code of your application should look something like this flask apppy from flask import flask rendertemplate request import spacy nlp spacyloadptcorenewssm app flaskname approute methodsget post def index if requestmethod post handle a post request and the data sent here xnlp nlprequestformgetx ynlp nlprequestformgety resultado xnlpsimilarityynlp return a rendered template and pass defined variables to the template return rendertemplateindexhtml locals html templatesindexhtml index if resultado similaridade resultado endif
74002390,spacy ner extract all persons before a specific word,spacy namedentityrecognition,you can use a matcher to find person entities that precede a specific word pattern enttype person orth asked because each dict corresponds to a single token this pattern would only match the last word of the entity ng you could let the first dict match more than one token with enttype person op but this runs the risk of matching two person entities in a row in an example like before ms x spoke to ms y ms z asked to be able to match a single entity more easily with a matcher you can add the component mergeentities to the end of your pipeline which merges each entity into a single token then this pattern would match louis ng as one token

73655387,spacy example object format for spancategorizer,initialization spacy,if you wantneed to create example objects directly the easiest way to do so is to use the function examplefromdict which takes a predicted doc and a dict predicted in this context is a doc with partial annotations representing data from previous components for many usecases it can just be a clean doc created with nlpmakedoctext what this function does is taking the annotations from the dict and using those to define the goldstandard that is now stored in the example object eg if you print this object using spacy youll see the internal representation of those goldstandard annotations docannotation cats entities o o o o o spans myspans loc loc doubleloc links tokenannotation orth i like london and berlin spacy true true true true false tag lemma pos morph head dep sentstart ps the parsegolddoc function in the docs is just a placeholderdummy function well clarify that in the docs to avoid confusion
73627739,python spacy wordpos counting using textread and textreadlines giving way different results,python spacy,the issue is that readlines will show a bunch of isolated lines while read will show one lump of text with newlines in it so imagine a sentence like this in a situation like this if you saw only the second line you wouldnt be able to tell if red is a noun or adjective for example in general things are going to be weird in that sense the read values are better but also note spacys training data doesnt include newlines while there is some whitespace augmentation to help with that depending on your spacy version its not perfect and itd be best to replaces newlines with spaces in a reasonable way and maybe feed a paragraph at a time also note the leftover newlines account for the large number of space tags youre seeing ah theres actually another problem you shouldnt call str here youll get a mess given an input file that looks like this if you do this you get this that kind of text format is not normal and will cause spacy to give you many strange results basically you should check that the input to spacy looks like normal plain text without strange formatting in order to ensure reasonable output

73401971,for spacys ner do i need to label the entire word as an entity,python spacy namedentityrecognition,you cant put an ner label on half a token the tokenizer is run before ner and the ner component attempts to give a label to each whole token so if youre only interested in part of a token the ner component wont be able to figure that out if you dont have some way to separate the tokens in preprocessing it seems like the only thing you can do is label the whole token youre right that will make it harder for the model to learn one alternative is to try training a characterlevel ner component basically split your input into individual characters before training
73381579,spacy entity ruler how to order patterns,python spacy,there are a couple of ways to do this a simple one is to use two entityrulers by default the second wont overwrite anything set by the first you could also use the relatively new spanruler with a custom filtering function which always prefers unknown entities

73363203,python spacy how to visulaize all the spans of a doc,python spacy,you can only display spans under one spanskey at a time if you want to display all spans you can copy all the spans to a single key and display that key
73358922,spacy spans labels how to add spans with a particular lable to a doc,python spacy,docspans is like a dictionary where each key is a string and each value is a spangroup which is basically a list of spans the reason docspans is a dictionary instead of just a single list of spans is so that you can have different components add lists of spans for different reasons or have a single component add different groups of spans for example if you a coreference component it could use one spangroup for each cluster where a cluster is lists of spans that refer to the same thing for the sentence john smith called from new york he said its raining there john smith he would be one cluster and new york there would be another if you had a spancat component and also a coref component they would both need to set spans on the doc but you wouldnt want those spans to get mixed up docspans allows you to keeps things clean and separate

72842842,how does spacy use the thinc parserstepmodel object in the pipeline,python spacy spacy,this is happening because there are two models in the spacy pipeline you have first the tokvec runs and creates embeddings of each token then those are used as features for the parser see the pipeline docs if you have trouble finding the type of anything its probably a cython type and youd need to check the cython source in spacy or thinc im not sure what a press is how are you getting it make a new question for that
72776930,spacy v getting zero loss as well as other metric during training using cli,pythonx spacy namedentityrecognition,it looks like your data is ner annotations but your pipeline contains only a tokvec and parser component it should contain an ner component use the quickstart to generate an ner config and start over from step in your list
72772448,spacy adding multiple patterns to a single ner using entity ruler,patternmatching spacy namedentityrecognition,each pattern you add to the ruler is one sequence of tokens so you arent matching each of those terms individually youre matching all of them in a row without punctuation you should add them as separate patterns something like this couple of other things you may need to set overwriteents true to get the results you want see here if your actual input looks like wan flex havelock st wan premium thats not the normal prose the spacy models were trained on and they may not work very well

72520863,is there a way to exclude an apostrophe s from entities in spacys ner component,spacy namedentityrecognition,there is no way to simply configure the component not to do this what you can do is use a small custom component to remove s from any entities see the docs for info on how to use it
72519750,installing spacy language models directly from conda environmentyml,python pip anaconda spacy,as the spacy documentation of download command states downloading best practices the download command is mostly intended as a convenient interactive wrapper it performs compatibility checks and prints detailed messages in case things go wrong its not recommended to use this command as part of an automated process if you know which package your project needs you should consider a direct download via pip or uploading the package to a local pypi installation and fetching it straight from there this will also allow you to add it as a versioned package dependency to your project while it is possible to include pypi dependencies in a conda environment yaml conda forge also publishes spacy models as packages via the spacymodelsfeedstock in the example from op this would mean adding the package spacymodelencorewebsm
72367406,add new pattern in entity ruler spacy with regex in multiple tokens,python regex entity spacy rulers,since your regexes are just for numeric tokens just add a new token to your pattern how can i add to the nlp model new rule based on regex that searches in the whole input the matcher just doesnt support that if you want to use regexes against the whole input you can do that yourself and add the spans directly you dont need the matcher
72350021,spacy matcher isnt always matching,pythonx spacy spacy,it looks like you may be running into issues with differences in tokenization for this kind of sequence in particular note that things that look like temperatures so number fck may get special treatment this may seem odd but it usually results in better compatibility with existing corpora you can find out why an input is tokenized a particular way using tokenizerexplain like so that gives the output you can read more about this at the tokenizerexplain docs
72337123,how to use custom named enitities dataset in spacys dependecymatcher,python dependencies spacy namedentityrecognition spacy,the dependencymatcher does not have a custom model of identifying peoples names thats the ner component in the pipeline you loaded in this case you should disable the ner component use an entityruler to label names use the dependencymatcher as usual to disable a component you can just do this to match names from your list with an entityruler see the rulebased matching docs note that the above assumes you have a list of names rather than annotations in sentences on exactly what is a name if you have explicitly annotated names then you can skip step disabling the ner component will be enough to leave only your existing annotations

72173262,create components for spacy pipeline,python spacy,it looks like youre writing a simple stateless component in spacy a stateless component can be defined as a function that takes a doc and returns the same doc your code has several problems first about how pipelines work you can think of a spacy pipeline the nlp call as working like this so basically each pipe is like a function and they are called in order on the doc so with your code the cause of the error youre getting is that inside the loop above youre calling nlp again which calls nlp again and so on you cant call nlp inside a component and shouldnt need to if that were the only problem you could do this but that wont work either youre returning a string but you need to return a doc it looks like youre trying to change each token in a doc into its lemma but you cant change the text of a doc thats a design decision in spacy so that wont work you should probably take a look at the docs on custom components if my understanding of what youre trying to do is correct this doesnt seem to make sense as a pipeline component and can just be postprocessing
72097848,how to load customized ner model from disk with spacy,spacy spacy,the general process you are following of serializing a single component and reloading it is not the recommended way to do this in spacy you can do it it has to be done internally of course but you generally want to save and load pipelines using highlevel wrappers in this case this means that you would save like this and then load it with spacyloadmymodel you can find more detail about this in the saving and loading docs since it seems youre just getting started with spacy you might want to go through the course too it covers the new configbased training in v which is much easier than using your own custom training loop like in your code sample if you want to mix and match components from different pipelines you still will generally want to save entire pipelines and you can then combine components from them using the sourcing feature

71859650,importing ner json into spacy,json spacy spacy,for training data spacy just requires docs that are set like the output you want saved in a docbin so for your case looping through your data and creating docs is the right thing to do you can do that with your examplecreating code and pull out the exreference doc an example is basically just two docs one annotated and one not though its not the only way see the sample code in the training data section of the docs its not exactly the same format as your data but its very similar
71847391,recognize newline n in text as end of sentence in spacy,spacy,the reason the sentencizer isnt doing anything here is that the parser has run first and already set all the sentence boundaries and then the sentencizer doesnt modify any existing sentence boundaries the sentencizer with n is only the right option if you know you have exactly one sentence per line in your input text otherwise a custom component that adds sentence starts after newlines but doesnt set all sentence boundaries is probably what you want if you want to set some custom sentence boundaries before running the parser you need be sure you add your custom component before the parser in the pipeline nlpaddpipemycomponent beforeparser your custom component would set tokenisstartstart true for the tokens right after newlines and leave all other tokens unmodified check out the second example here

71635441,retrain custom language model with the current spacy version compatibility issues,python pythonx spacy spacy,in nearly all cases spacy v models are forwardscompatible with newer versions of spacy v so download jacorenewstrf and then install the vietnamese model with pip install nodeps so that pip doesnt install an older version of spacy as a dependency youll get a warning on load that an older model might be incompatible but test it on your data and as long as the performance is the same as with the older version of spacy it should be fine to use see you can only retrain the model if you have access to the original training data

71481327,tweek spacy spans,python spacy,there is a chapter in spacy doc dedicated to matching based on rules you can use spacy to match spans based on regex like rules and also you can extend the pipeline to include your rules and for example recognize entities with names using your rules from docs compared to using regular expressions on raw text spacys rulebased matcher engines and components not only let you find the words and phrases youre looking for they also give you access to the tokens within the document and their relationships this means you can easily access and analyze the surrounding tokens merge spans into single tokens or add entries to the named entities in docents as you can see in the following example taken from the documentation it is very easy to define the rules using spacys matcher class and iterate over the results on the other hand you can also use the entityruler class if you want to extend the spacy pipeline and recognize named entities based on regular expressionlike rules i modify your code to show you more or less how it would be surely you have to work the rules a bit to recognize exactly the numbers with the format that interests you as you can see now instead of iterating over the text tokens i iterate over the list of entities recognized by the pipeline and keep only those that have the name digit which is the one that interests me import spacy from spacymatcher import matcher nlp spacyloadencoreweblg textthe car comprises brakes and in fig all include an esp system this is shown in fig fig shows how the motors and are blocked besides the doors are painted blue add entityruler to pipeline ruler nlpaddpipeentityruler beforener configvalidate true patterns label digit pattern isdigit true ispunct true isdigit true ruleraddpatternspatterns print digit ents printentlabel textentstartcharentendchar for ent in docents if entlabel digit im sorry i cant give you working code that does what you want but i think this is a good starting point to get what youre looking for

71117302,spacy lemmatizer suddenly returns other value than three months ago words are not transformed into the singular form anymore,python spacy lemmatization,it sounds like the version of spacy definitely changed maybe from v to v first if spacy is slow see the speed faq next note that spacys lemmatizer is clever so it relies on the part of speech of a word since that can affect the lemma this is why changing the contents of your string changes your lemmas spacy thinks thats a weird sentence and tries to predict the part of speech of each word and probably doesnt do so well since its not actually a sentence spacy is designed to take natural language like full sentences as input not arbitrary lists of words if you just need to lemmatize standalone words youre better off using the lemmatizer in spacy as a standalone component or even using the underlying data files directly theres not a guide for that but if you look at spacylookupsdata you can access it easily enough
71102925,training with spacy on full dataset,spacy,no spacy does not automatically merge your datasets before training modelbest if you want to do that you would need to manually create a new training data set if you have so little data that seems like a good idea you should probably prioritize getting more data

70905201,finding nonexisting words with spacy,spacy lemmatization,spacy does not include functionality for checking if a word is in the dictionary or not if youve loaded a pipeline with vectors you can use hasvector to check if a word vector is present for a given token this is kind of similar to checking if a word is in the dictionary but it depends on the vectors for most languages the vectors just include any word that appeared at least a certain number of times in a training corpus so common typos or other strange things will be present while some words may be randomly missing if you want to detect real words in some way its best to source your own list

70529646,spacy detect if entity is quoted,spacy spacy,your custom extension looks fine if you only care about quotes immediately before and after you just need to handle the case where the span is at the start or end of the doc correctly which you arent doing now if the span is at the start youll check doc the last token for example do you care about things like john said i never though id meet peter smith where peter smith is an entity if so i would figure out a policy for nested quotes maybe just ignore them if rare and create an extension that walks through each sentence and marks each token as in quotes or not in quotes with quotes themselves defined however you want if you care about complex cases i wouldnt use a matcher for this it cant handle nesting well and i think any solution with it would be more complicated than basic state tracking if you only care about immediately before and after it should be fine
70502457,do i need to do any text cleaning for spacy ner,python spacy namedentityrecognition,first spacy does no transformation of the input it takes it literally asis and preserves the format so you dont lose any information when you provide text to spacy that said input to spacy with the pretrained pipelines will work best if it is in natural sentences with no weird punctuation like a newspaper article because thats what spacys training data looks like to that end you should remove meaningless white space like newlines leading and trailing spaces or formatting characters maybe a line of but thats about all the cleanup you have to do the spacy training data wont have bullets so they might get some weird results but i would leave them in to start also bullets are obviously printable characters maybe you mean nonascii i have no idea what you mean by muck with the indexes but for some older nlp methods it was common to do more extensive preprocessing like removing stop words and lowercasing everything doing that will make things worse with spacy because it uses the information you are removing for clues just like a human reader would note that you can train your own models in which case theyll learn about the kind of text you show them in that case you can get rid of preprocessing entirely though for actually meaningless things like newlines leading and following spaces you might as well remove them anyway to address your new info briefly yes character indexes for ner labels must be updated if you do preprocessing if they arent updated they arent usable it looks like youre trying to extract skills from a resume that has many bullet point lists the spacy training data is newspaper articles which dont contain any lists like that so its hard to say what the right thing to do is i dont think the bullets matter much but you can try removing or not removing them what about stuff like lowercasing stop words lemmatizing etc i already addressed this but do not do this this was historically common practice for nlp models but for modern neural models including spacy it is actively unhelpful
70432899,how to export spacy model with multiple components,python spacy spacy,at the place where you load the model you need to have access to the code that defined the custom component so if your file that defines the custom component is custompy you can put import custom at the top of the file where youre loading your pipeline and it should work also see the docs on saving and loading custom components

70203388,manually set sentence boundaries in spacy,python spacy sentence,you cant put sentence boundaries at arbitrary characters spacy wont let you put a sentence in the middle of a token what you can do is iterate over tokens and use tokenidx the character index of the token to apply your boundaries by finding the token that lines up with your boundary index youll have to figure out a policy for what to do if token boundaries dont line up with your values whether thats throwing an exception or dealing with it somehow

70085180,is it possible to export and use a spacy ner model without an vocab and inject tokensvectors on the fly,python spacy,in spacy v not v there are some hidden background steps that register the vectors globally under a particular name for use as features in the statistical models the idea behind this is that multiple models in the same process can potentially share the same vectors in ram to get a subset of vectors to work for a particular text you need to register the new vectors under the right name use the same vectorsname as in the model metadata when creating the vectors will be something like encoreweblgvectors run spacymllinkvectorstomodelsvocab im pretty sure that this will start printing warnings and renaming the vectors internally based on the data shape if you do it repeatedly for different sets of vectors with the same name i think you can ignore the warnings and it will work for that individual text but it may break any other models loaded in the same script that are using that same vectors nameshape if you are doing this a lot in practice you might want to write a custom version of linkvectorstomodels that iterates over the words in the vocab more efficiently for very small vector tables or only modifies the words in the vocab that you know that you need it really depends on the size of the vocab at the point where youre running linkvectorstomodels

69994196,spacys phrasematcher with reflexive pronoun in french,python pythonx spacy spacy,you can use dependency relations for this pasting some example reflexive verb sentences into the displacy demo you can see that the reflexive pronouns for these verbs always have an explcomp relation a very simple way to find these verbs is to just iterate over tokens and check for that relation i am not sure this is the only way its used so you should check that but it seems likely i dont know french so im not sure if these verbs have strict ordering or if words can come between the pronoun and the verb if the latter which seems likely you cant use the normal matcher or phrasematcher because they rely on contiguous sequences of words but you can use the dependencymatcher something like this this assumes that you only care about verb lemmas if you care about the verbpronoun combination you can just make a bunch of depmatcher rules or something

69883861,incorrect entity being returned by entitylinker spacy,spacy entitylinking,the way the entity linker works is that given all potential candidates for an entity it picks the most likely one the issue you are running into is that your florist is not known to the model so he is not a candidate because the only barack obama the model knows about is the former us president the model can say with certainty that barack obama must refer to the president the model has no mechanism to tell if a reference refers to an entity not in the knowledge base it will also never abstain and if there are candidates it will pick one nil is not an abstention its for when a reference has no entries in the knowledge base so theres nothing to pick from this may be clearer if you look at the example project which uses emerson as an example the model doesnt decide if emerson is a person it knows or not it assumes that it must be one of the people it knows and it has to pick which one is most likely

68807645,how to use spacy to count the number of words in each row of a column,python pandas dataframe spacy,if you want to use the spacy tokenizer i would suggest some list comprehension the oneliner says basically for element in list get rid of html markers process with spacy and count the tokens if it is neither space nor punctuation output but as you see s was here counted as two tokens by spacy so unless there is a huge advantage for you to use spacy or you do need a specific tokenizer counting words by simply splitting spaces would be definitly the preferred way just as suggested by mdr

68421514,is there a way to set spacys pos tagging,python spacy,the first thing to note is that lemmatization does not always come out right whats more problematic in your case though is that it is a contextsensitive operation in the context of a sentence loved is correctly recognized as a verb and lemmatized accordingly my solution would be to pass complete sentences to spacy and remap the resulting lemmas to the original tokenization afterwards which is somewhat more work but should get the best results in terms of lemmatization rejoining and nlping the sentences df pddataframefromrecordshe loved floors i dont like vacuums columnssubject verb object dfrawtokens dfsubject verb objectvaluestolist dfdoc dfrawtokensagg joinapplynlp subject verb object rawtokens doc he loved floors he loved floors he loved floors i dont like vacuums i dont like vacuums i do nt like vacuums aligning the two tokenizations we need to turn the doc column into a list of lemmas which we can regroup later on while preserving the original tokenization one way to achieve this is to use spacys builtin alignment module given two lists of tokens with different tokenizations this will give you a mapping of one list to the other by indices eg from spacytraining import alignment rawtoks i dont like vacuums spacytoks i do nt like vacuums alignment alignmentfromstringsrawtoks spacytoks printlistalignmentxydataxd printlistalignmentyxdataxd this tells us that the tokens at index and in spacytoks belong to token in rawtoks in the function below i used that to map tokens to the original tokenization after processing them with spacy but instead of token strings we collect lemmas the idea is to turn an input like spacytoks above into i do nt like vacuum from spacytraining import alignment from itertools import groupby def lemmatizerow tokens lemmas zipxtext xlemma for x in rowdoc lemmas iterlemmas so we can use next get alignment of surface token strings alignment alignmentfromstringsrowrawtokens tokensyxdataxd lemmamap list collect lemmas into subgroups for g in groupbyalignment lemmamapappendnextlemmas for in g return joinw for w in lemmamap applying it to the dataframe dflemmas dfapplylemmatize axis some cleaning dfsubjectlemma verblemma objectlemma pddataframedflemmastolist indexdfindex final result subject verb object subjectlemma verblemma objectlemma he loved floors he love floor i dont like vacuums i do nt like vacuum
68421177,spacy how to create a pattern to match a string caught via speechrecognition,python spacy speechtotext,to summarize your problem you are getting single words but you want to capture multiple words that are a single unit like right arm you can do this with the dependency matcher but itll take a little work basically you want to match the whole subtree of the single word youre getting now in the phrase right arm arm is the head noun and right will depend on arm all the words that depend on arm directly or indirectly through other words are called the subtree understanding the dependencies is a little complicated but very powerful i recommend you read chapter in the jurafsky and martin book which is a straightforward guide to dependency parsing feel free to skim lots of it that said for the kind of phrases you want there is a simpler method you can try in spacy try using the mergenounchunks function which will turn chunks into single tokens which are easier to work with a noun chunk is kind of hard to define and the way it works in spacy may not be exactly what you want but you can also look at the source for it to write your own definition if you want in order for that to work you will have to understand dependency parsing though

68193903,using regex and orth as part of phrasematching in spacy,python spacy,orth meaning orthography was used before text was introduced in spacy now when doing regex matching youd better apply that to text as for the regex itself mind that it is applied to the whole token text and in order to match the entire token text you need to use anchors and or a and z so you can use text regex raaplaz also note the use of a raw string literal so as to avoid double escaping backslashes

68061849,get spacy ner to search only for company name and not waste computing power on anything else using existing language models,python spacy,you cant change the models to only tag one named entity you can ignore entities you dont care about trivially you cant cut out the other entities because they arent like separate functions the model uses its knowledge about all the different types to help it figure out ambiguous cases like knowing john smith is a person but john deere is probably a company the good news is that it is not processing useless information or wasting computing power if you trained a model to recognize just org entities it wouldnt be faster or anything

68004162,spacy create a nested taxonomy using phrasematcher,python spacy,it sounds like you want to be able to add metadata to matches to identify things that are the same in your scheme to do that you should have a look at adding ids to match patterns using the entityruler heres an example from the spacy docs in this case sanfrancisco is an id but you could add ids like headhex to identify all the variations of hexagon in your patterns note that i would refer to what youre trying to do as normalization or possibly finegrained entity labelling not as creating a taxonomy im not sure what you mean by nested taxonomy i guess you mean that your labels are nested like you have a head and then within head you have different categories like hex or phillips it might be helpful if you gave more examples of the kinds of output you want the issue with your pattern not getting your iso patterns is probably because something like is ending up as multiple tokens change your patterns to be like this when you pass a string spacy will figure out the tokenization for you since your patterns here are just numbers it doesnt matter but if you actually need to match on the lower attribute look at the docs on matching on other attributes

67748845,spacy regex phrase matcher in python,python regex spacy matchphrase,the issue is that in the matcher by default each dictionary in the pattern corresponds to exactly one token so your regex doesnt match any number of characters it matches any one token which isnt what you want to get what you want you can use the op value to specify that you want to match any number of tokens see the operators or quantifiers section in the docs however given your problem you probably want to actually use the dependency matcher instead so i rewrote your code to use that as well try this one other less important thing the way you were calling the matcher was kind of weird you can pass the matcher docs or spans but they should definitely be natural text so calling lemma on the sentence and creating a fresh doc from that worked in your case but in general should be avoided

66503956,spacy installed files are different from the files in github repo,spacy,when developing a python library small changes are saved in git as theyre made but theyre only released to pypi when the maintainer intentionally makes a release so its normal for the files on your computer to be a little different from the files in a git repo even if you have a very recent release i was really confused about the sentencizerpy code you posted since there doesnt seem to have ever been a file with that name in spacy but it looks like that is a magic pycharm feature its not showing you the actual source code its doing some sort of decompilation you noticed spacy has the sentencizerpyx file thats compiled into a binary so file that python runs when you use the code pycharm is presumably working backwards from the so file

66158457,how much data context needed to train custom ner spacy model,machinelearning model spacy namedentityrecognition,generally named entity recognition relies on the context of words otherwise the model would not be able to detect entities in previously unseen words consequently the list of titles would not help you to train any model you could rather run string matching to find any of those titles in cv documents and you will even be guaranteed to find all of them no unknown titles though i you could find or less real cvs and replace the job names by those in your list or others then you are all set to train a model capable of ner this would be the way to go i suppose just download as many freely available cvs from the web and see where this gets you if it is not enough data you can augment it for example by exchanging the job titles in the data by some of the titles in your list

62921756,how to assign lexical features to new unanalyzable tokens in spacy,spacy,the tagger and parser are independent the parser doesnt use the tags as features so modifying the tags isnt going to affect the dependency parse the tagger doesnt overwrite any existing tags so if a tag is already set it doesnt modify it the existing tags dont influence its predictions at all though so the surrounding words are tagged the same way they would be otherwise setting tag and pos in the retokenizer is a good way to set those attributes if youre not always retokenizing and you want to set the tag andor pos based on a regular expression for the token text then the best way to do this is a custom pipeline component that you add before the tagger that sets tags for certain words the transitionbased parsing algorithm cant easily deal with partial dependencies in the input so there isnt a straightforward solution here i can think of a few things that might help the parser does respect preset sentence boundaries if your skipped tokens are between sentences you can set tokenissentstart true for that token and the following token so that the skipped token always ends up in its own sentence if the skipped tokens are in the middle of a sentence or you want them to be analyzed as nouns in the sentence then this wont help the parser does use the tokennorm feature so if you set the norm feature in the retokenizer to something extremely propnlike you might have a better chance of getting the intended analysis for example if youre using a provided english model like encorewebsm use a word you think would be a frequent similar proper noun in american newspaper text from years ago so if the skipped token should be like a last name use bush or clinton it wont guarantee a better parse but it could help if you using a model with vectors like encoreweblg you can also set the vectors for the skipped token to be the same as a similar word check that the similar word has a vector first this is how to tell the model to refer to the same row in the vector table for unknownskipped as bush the simpler option that duplicates the vectors in the vector table internally the less elegant version that doesnt duplicate vectors underneath the second line is only necessary to get this to work for a model thats currently loaded if you save it as a custom model after the first line with nlptodisk and reload it then only the first line is necessary if you just have a small set of skipped tokens you could update the parser with some examples containing these tokens but this can be tricky to do well without affecting the accuracy of the parser for other cases the norm and vector modifications will also influence the tagger so its possible if you choose those well you might get pretty close to the results you want

62153385,how do i train a pseudoprojective parser on spacy,spacy dependencyparsing,the problem is that the simple training example script isnt projectivitizing the training instances when initializing and training the model the parsing algorithm itself can only handle projective parses but if the parser component finds projectivized labels in its output theyre deprojectivitzed in a postprocessing step you dont need to modify any parser settings so starting with a german model makes no difference just provide projectivized input in the right format the initial projectivization is handled automatically by the train cli which uses goldcorpustraindocs to prepare the training examples for nlpupdate and sets makeprojectivetrue when creating the goldparses in general id recommend switching to the train cli which also requires switching to the internal json training format which is admittedly a minor hassle because the train cli sets a lot of better defaults however a toy example also works fine as long as you create projectivized training examples with goldparsemakeprojectivetrue add all the projectivized dependency labels to the parser and train with doc and the projectivized goldparse input instead of the textannotation input

60534999,how to solve spanish lemmatization problems with spacy,python spacy lemmatization,unlike the english lemmatizer spacys spanish lemmatizer does not use pos information at all it relies on a lookup list of inflected verbs and lemmas eg ideo idear ideas idear idea idear ideamos idear etc it will just output the first match in the list regardless of its pos i actually developed spacys new rulebased lemmatizer for spanish which takes pos and morphological information such as tense gender number into account these finegrained rules make it a lot more accurate than the current lookup lemmatizer it will be released soon meanwhile you can maybe use stanford corenlp or freeling
60533029,what is a good way to speed up test runs utilizing larger spacy models,python testing spacy,the v md models have a minor bug that make them particularly slow to load see you can reformat one file in the model package to improve the load time in the vocab directory for the model package eg libpythonsitepackagesencorewebmdencorewebmdvocab in my tests this nearly halves the loading time s to s the remaining time is mostly loading strings and lexemes for the model which is harder to optimize further at this point so this improves things a bit but the overall load time is still relatively burdensome for short tests

60176633,does the notation of a named entity label type in spacy have to match with the notation of the annotated label type in the training data,spacy trainingdata namedentityrecognition webanno,yes of course you want to keep annotations aligned if its a oneoff operation it might be easiest to bruteforce the problem by replacing the string in your data the more canonical option would appear to be tagmap quote you need to define how your tags map down to the universal dependencies tag set their example
60173314,spacy entity linking using descriptions from wikipedia,python spacy namedentityrecognition,i believe all the action happens in the line before the one you quoted this is that funtion is one file over at that being said having gone through this process a few days ago i did get the impression that its all in flux and there may be a bit of a mismatch between descriptions the actual code and versions of spacy you may have noticed that the readme starts with the instruction run wikipediapretrainkbpy and yet such a file does not exist only wikidatapretrainkbpy while the process did work ventually the final training progresses at a glacial speed of seconds per example for examples in the training set that would imply about a year of training at the default epochs there are some instructions that suggest one isnt intended to run all the training data thats available but in that case it seems strange to run epochs on a repeating set of data with diminishing rates of return updated urls nov this example did not make it over from v v yet

60087163,is there a function in spacy to get the string given hash,spacy,no you will need to keep a copy of the stringstore from the pipeline you used to process your documents in order to look up strings for hashes in the future in the end its nothing more than a list of strings that have been seen before either as tokens or annotations which you can simply readd to a new stringstore

59927844,is it possible to install spacy to raspberry pi raspbian buster,python pythonx raspberrypi arm spacy,disclaimer the build might take a long time on a single rpi if you have a cluster of multiple pis available it may be wise to invest into setting up distcc on them this will also reduce the last step verifying the build by running the tests as pytest supports distributed test running on multiple hosts with the pytestxdist plugin so running the tests will pass a lot faster on a cluster also although crosscompiling for arm on a x system is a lot more faster option a proper setup may take a lot more time than the slow native compilation so beware get the prebuilt wheels if you want to save time i have uploaded the wheels built using the command sequence in this answer on github install using my own index proxy or using direct links preliminaries preparations install the compiler atlas and create a new virtual env for building dont use the builtin venv module for the virtual env creation or you will have to adjust the compilation options yourself pointing to the env manually blis build this follows more or less exactly the steps from the projects readme this last command should run without errors generating the blisarchjsonl file with system configuration eg cortexajsonl in this example if this command fails try an older arch eg cortexa cortexa cortexa etc until it fits see the list of arch names for example for my rpi its cortexa once the compilation is done build the blis wheel if the command succeeds check out the contents of the dist dir spacy build simply download the source dist and build a wheel from it once the build is done the dist dir should also contain the spacy wheel you can now copy the wheels somewhere safe and reuse them when in need of reinstalling blis or spacy to install from the built wheels issue testing the installation after you have installed spacy from your built wheel it may be wise to run the tests to ensure you have actually built something usable install pytest and test dependencies to run the tests distributed on all cores ans speedup the execution install pytestxdist in addition and append the nauto flag to the above command
59921660,can i use the spacy command line tools to train an ner model containing an additional entity type,spacy,ines answered this for me on the prodigy support forum i think whats happening here is that the spacy train command expects the base model you want to update to already have all labels added that you want to train it processes the data as a stream so its not going to compile all labels upfront and silently add them on the fly so if you want to update an existing pretrained model and add a new label you should be able to just add the label and save out the base model this isnt quite writing no code but its pretty close

59609202,save spacy phrasematcher to disk,spacy,you can save time some time initially by using nlptokenizerpipe to process your texts this just tokenizes which is much faster than running the full en pipeline if youre using certain attr settings with phrasematcher you may need nlppipe instead but you should get an error if this is the case you can pickle a phrasematcher to save it to disk unpickling is not extremely fast because it has to reconstruct some internal data structures but it should be a quite a bit faster than creating the phrasematcher from scratch
59500498,spacy tokenizer is there a way to use regex as a key in custom exceptions for updateexc,spacy,no theres no way to have regular expressions as tokenizer exceptions the tokenizer only looks for exceptions as exact string matches mainly for reasons of speed the other difficulty for this kind of example is that tokenizer exceptions currently cant contain spaces support for spaces is planned for a future version of spacy but not regexes which would still be too slow i think the best way to do this would be to add a custom pipeline component at the beginning of the pipeline that retokenizes the document with the retokenizer you can provide any required attributes like lemmas while retokenizing

57963657,what is the best way to benchmark custom components in a spacy pipeline,python spacy,this is a good question and the extension attribute idea is actually very clever the only downside is that youd have to add debugging code to all of your existing components which also works less well if theyre thirdparty code but if you know that the offending code is part of your codebase this shouldnt be a problem another option would be to wrap each pipeline component in a function that logs the timestamp and whatever else you need and returns pipedoc you can then overwrite nlppipeline with those wrapped components def wrappipename pipe def wrappeddoc printfstarted name datetimedatetimenow return pipedoc return wrapped def debugwrappipelinenlp nlppipeline name wrappipename pipe for name pipe in nlppipeline return nlp debugnlp debugwrappipelinenlp however the downside here is that youd also need to wrap each components pipe method if available so you can run and debug nlppipe under the same conditions if youre benchmarking you often want to do this at a larger scale and process a stream of texts with nlppipe to avoid this a slightly more verbose option could be to add a debug component before each existing component in the pipeline basically something like this def makedebugcomponentname def debugcomponentdoc printfbefore name datetimedatetimenow return doc return debugcomponent def debugwrappipelinenlp pipeline listnlppipeline we dont want to modify this while were looping over it for name pipe in pipeline debugcomponent makedebugcomponentname nlpaddpipedebugcomponent beforename namefdebugname return nlp disclaimer i only just hacked those ideas together and havent tested them extensively yet but they did seem to work if you end up exploring this id be very curious to hear what worked best it might also be a feature that spacy could ship with outofthebox and itd pair well with the proposed static analysis for pipeline components also just to add for completeness when debugging text processing pipelines like this always benchmark things on a larger scale with a single corpus that you process once rather than looping over a single example times or something like that there are caching effects both within spacy but also the cpu differences in memory allocation and so on that can all have an impact and make the smallscale tests less reliable of course in a scenario like this where youre experiencing drastic differences even processing a single text can probably give you enough clues and everything you need to debug your code further

57678190,is there a fast way to get the tokens for each sentence in spacy,spacy,the main problem with your approach is that youre processing everything twice a sentence in docsents is a span object ie a sequence of tokens so theres no need to call nlp on the sentence text again spacy already does all of this for you under the hood and the doc you get back already includes all information you need so if you need a list of strings one for each token you can do sentencetokens for sent in docsents sentencetokensappendtokentext for token in sent or even shorter sentencetokens tokentext for token in sent for sent in docsents if youre processing a lot of texts you probably also want to use nlppipe to make it more efficient this will process the texts in batches and yield doc objects you can read more about it here texts some text lots and lots of texts for doc in nlppipetexts sentencetokens tokentext for token in sent for sent in docsents do something with the tokens
57660268,how to specify spacy to recognize a sentence based on full stop,python spacy,what you probably want to do is define a custom sentence segmentizer the default sentence segmentizing algorithm spacy employs uses a dependency tree to attempt to figure out where sentences begin and end you can override this by making your own function that defines sentence boundaries and adding it to the nlp pipeline following the example in spacys documentation your text is very different from natural language so its no wonder spacy doesnt do a great job its internal models are trained on examples that look explicitly like text you would read in a book or on the internet while your example looks more like machinereadable lists of numbers for instance if the text you used were written out more like prose it might look something like this shop s numbers were and shop for the first months had numbers and shop after months had and shop and shop in the first months had numbers and after months shop had and using this as the input gives spacys default parser a much better chance at figuring out where the sentence breaks are even with all those other punctuation marks note that this is not foolproof and the default parser will still mess up if the sentence structure gets too complex or fancy nlp in general and spacy in particular is not about parsing a small data set to extract particular values exactly right every time its more about parsing gigabytes of documents quickly and doing a good enough job in a statistical sense to perform meaningful computations on the data
57658888,how to specify word vector for oov terms in spacy,python wordvec spacy,if you simply want your plugvector instead of the spacy default allzeros vector you could just add an extra step where you replace any allzeros vectors with yours for example im not sure why youd want to do this lots of work with wordvectors simply elides outofvocabulary words using any plug value including spacys zerovector may just be adding unhelpful noise and if better handling of oov words is important note that some other wordvector models like fasttext can synthesize betterthannothing guessvectors for oov words by using vectors learned for subword fragments during training thats similar to how people can often work out the gist of a word from familiar wordroots

57551479,conversion of custom data to spacy ner format,spacy,spacy has builtin converters for some common formats but this isnt quite one of them i think the easiest one to convert to would be the conll ner format which would need two additional spaceseparated columns with placeholder values in between the words and tags so that the iob tags are in the th column no o bnum p o r o name o ryan bper dsouza bper put blank lines between sentences and if you have multiple documents in one file you can add this between documents to separate them then you can use a builtin converter also are you sure two bper tags in a row is correct for ryan dsouza in your data
57536896,custom entity ruler with spacy did not return a match,python spacy,the problem is an interaction between the ner component provided in the english model and your entityruler component the ner component finds as a number cardinal and theres a restriction that entities arent allowed to overlap so the entityruler component doesnt find any matches you can either add your entityruler before the ner component or tell the entityruler that its allowed to overwrite existing entities
57536044,add multiple entityruler with spacy valueerror entityruler already exists in pipeline,python spacy,you can add another custom entity ruler to your pipeline by changing its name to avoid name collision here is some code to illustrate but please read the remark below we can verify that the pipeline does contain both entity rulers remark i would suggest using the simpler and more natural approach of making a new entity ruler which contains the rules of both entity rulers finally concerning your question about best practices for entity labels it is a common practice to use abbreviations written with capital letters see spacy ner documentation for example org loc person etc edits following questions if you do not need spacys default named entity recognition ner then i would suggest disabling it as that will speedup computations and avoid interference see discussion about this here disabling ner will not cause unexpected downstream results your document just wont be tagged for the default entities loc org person etc there is this idea in programming that simple is better than complex see here there can be some subjectivity as to what constitutes a simpler solution i would think that a processing pipeline with fewer components is simpler ie the pipeline containing both entity rulers would seem more complex to me however depending on your needs in terms of profiling adjustability etc it might be simpler for you have several different entity rulers as described in the first part of this solution it would be nice to get the authors of spacy to give their view on these two different design choices naturally the single entity ruler above can be directly created as follows the other code above shown for constructing rulerall is meant to illustrate how we can query an entity ruler for the list of patterns which have been added to it in practice we would construct rulerall directly without first constructing rulerplant and ruleranimal unless we wanted to test and profile these rulerplant and ruleranimal individually
57535597,restrict entity types in spacy ner,spacy,short answer no you cannot restrict ner to not tag specific tags or the opposite what you can do is limit it in code or modify the model see long answer limiting it in code is just filtering the retrieved entities but it wont solve your problem with missclassifications long answer you can restrict ner in spacy but not with a simple parameter currently why not simple ner is a supervised machine learning task you provide text with tagged entities it trains and then attempts to predict new instances from the parameters it learned beforehand if you want ner only to recognize certain entities such as orgs you have to train a new model only with org instances if youre familiar with machine learning concepts youll understand it this way in a multi class classification task you cannot simply remove a class without retraining the entire model with filtered train data check this page for more info on ner training

57363275,how does textcategorizerpredict work with spacy,label classification spacy predict,the predict methods of pipeline components actually expect a doc as input so youll need to do something like textcatpredictnlptext the nlp used there does not necessarily have a textcat component the result of that call then needs to be fed into a call to setannotations as shown here however your first approach is just fine internally when calling nlptext first the doc for the text will be generated and then each pipeline component one by one will run its predict method on that doc and keep adding information to it with setannotations eventually the textcat component will define the cats variable of the doc the api docs from which youre citing for the other approach kind of give you a look under the hood so theyre not really conflicting approaches

57199811,create a spacy pipeline with my own tokeniser,spacy,the reason the tokenizer isnt part of the regular pipeline is because its special there can only really be one and while all other pipeline components take a doc and return it the tokenizer takes a string of text and turns it into a doc however nlptokenizer is writable so you can either create your own tokenizer class from scratch or even replace it with an entirely custom function heres a super simple example that shows the idea from spacylangen import english from spacytokens import doc nlp english def mytokenizertext tokens textsplit doc docnlpvocab wordstokens return doc nlptokenizer mytokenizer doc nlphello world printtokentext for token in doc hello world
57187116,how to modify spacytokensdocdoc tokens with pipeline components in spacy,pythonx spacy,one of the core principles of spacys doc is that it should always represent the original input spacys tokenization is nondestructive so it always represents the original input text and never adds or deletes anything this is kind of a core principle of the doc object you should always be able to reconstruct and reproduce the original input text while you can work around that there are usually better ways to achieve the same thing without breaking the input text doc text consistency ive outlined some approaches for excluding tokens without destroying the original input in my comment here alternatively if you really want to modify the doc your component could create a new doc object and return that the doc object takes a vocab eg the original docs vocab a list of string words and an optional list of spaces a list of booleans indicating whether the token at that position is followed by a space or not from spacytokens import doc def preprocesstextdoc generate a new list of tokens here newwords createnewwordsheredoc newdoc docdocvocab wordsnewwords return newdoc note that you probably want to add this component first in the pipeline before other components run otherwise youd lose any linguistic features assigned by previous components like partofspeech tags dependencies etc

57005566,how to improve accuracy of rasa nlu while using spacy as pipeline,spacy rasanlu,its probably an overdone answer but likely you just need more training data and that probably means that you have to include some other words besides delete yes spacy can generalize outside of words you include but if all of your training data for that intent uses the word delete then you are training it to only accept that word or that word is extremely important if you include more similar words to delete you train it that related words are allowed as far as the tensorflow pipeline it doesnt even know the words exist until you use them so you would be best served including remove at least once so it can build the vectors connecting delete and remove and cancel call off drop etc as well also you are currently using the small spacy language model it may be useful trying one of the larger ones once youve got more training data

56752216,how do i handling exceptions with python generators using spacy,python pythonx exception generator spacy,it looks like your main problem is that your trycatch statement will currently halt execution on the first error it encounters to continue yielding files when an error is encountered you need to place your trycatch further down in the forloop ie you can wrap the with open context manager note also that a blanket trycatch is considered an antipattern in python so typically you will want to catch and handle the errors explicitly instead of using the general purpose exception i included the more explicit ioerror and oserror as examples lastly because you can catch the errors in the generator itself the nlppipe function no longer needs the astuple param edit to answer followup question note you are still reading the contents of the text documents one at a time as you would have without a generator however doing so via a generator returns an object that defers the execution until after you pass it into the nlppipe method spacy then processes one batch of the text documents at a time via its internal utilminibatch function that function ends in yield listbatch which executes the code that openscloses the files at a time in your case so as regards any nonspacy related errors ie errors associated with the openingreading of the file the code i posted should work as is however as it stands both your oswalk and my pathpathrglob are indiscriminately picking up any file in the directory regardless of its filetype so for example if there were an png file in your tmp folder then spacy would raise a typeerror during the tokenization process if you are wanting to capture those kinds of errors then your best bet is to anticipate and avoid them before sending them to spacy eg by amending your code with a whitelist that only allows certain file extensions rglobtxt if you are working on a project that for some reason or another cannot afford to be interrupted by an error no matter the cost and supposing you absolutely needed to know at which stage of the pipeline the error occurred then one approach might be to create a custom pipeline component for each default spacy pipeline component tagger dependencyparser etc you intend to use you would then need to wrap said components in the blanket error handlinglogging logic having done that you could then process your files using your completely custom pipeline but unless there is a gun pointed at your head i would not recommend it much better would be to anticipate the errors you expect to occur and handle them inside your generator perhaps someone with better knowledge of spacys internals will have a better suggestion though

56728218,how to mock spacy models doc objects for unit tests,unittesting spacy,this is a great question actually id say your instinct is definitely right if all you need is a doc object in a given state and with given annotations always create it manually wherever possible and unless youre explicitly testing a statistical model avoid loading it in your unit tests it makes the tests slow and it introduces too much unnecessary variance this is also very much in line with the philosophy of unit testing you want to be writing independent tests for one thing at a time not one thing plus a bunch of thirdparty library code plus a statistical model some general tips and ideas if possible always construct a doc manually avoid loading models or language subclasses unless your application or test specifically needs the doctext you do not have to set the spaces in fact i leave this out in about of the tests i write because it really only becomes relevant when youre putting the tokens back together if you need to create a lot of doc objects in your test suite you could consider using a utility function similar to the getdoc helper we use in the spacy test suite that function also shows you how the individual annotations are set manually in case you need it use sessionscoped fixtures for the shared objects like the vocab depending on what youre testing you might want to explicitly use the english vocab in the spacy test suite we do this by setting up an envocab fixture in the conftestpy instead of setting the docents to a list of tuples you can also make it a list of span objects this looks a bit more straightforward is easier to read and in spacy v you can also pass a string as a label def testentitiesenvocab doc docenvocab wordshello world docents spandoc labelorg assert docentstext hello if you do need to test a model eg in the test suite that makes sure that your custom models load and run as expected or a language class like english put them in a sessionscoped fixture this means that theyll only be loaded once per session instead of once per test language classes are lazyloaded and may also take some time to load depending on the data they contain so you only want to do this once note you probably dont have to do any of this unless youre testing your own custom models or language classes pytestfixturescopesession def encorewebsm return spacyloadencorewebsm pytestfixturescopesession def enlangclass langcls spacyutilgetlangclassen return langcls def testenlangclass doc enlangclasshello world

55852115,token extension versus matcher versus phrase matcher vs entity ruler in spacy,python performance spacy,i think ultimately it all comes down to finding the optimal tradeoff between speed maintainability of the code and the way this piece of logic fits into the larger picture of your application finding a few strings in a text is unlikely to be the end goal of what youre trying to do otherwise you probably wouldnt be using spacy and would stick to regular expressions how your application needs to consume the result of the matching and what the matches mean in the larger context should motivate the approach you choose as you mention in the conclusion if your matches are named entities by definition adding them to the docents makes a lot of sense and will even give you an easy way to combine your logic with statistical predictions even if it adds slightly more overhead itll likely still outperform any scaffolding youd otherwise have to write around it yourself for each solution i start with an initial setup if youre running the experiments in the same session eg in a notebook you may want to include the creation of the doc object in your initial setup otherwise the caching of the vocabulary entries could theoretically mean that the very first call of nlptext is slower than the subsequent calls its likely insignificant though i was quite surprised that the token matcher outperforms the phrase matcher i thought it would be opposite one potential explanation is that youre profiling the approaches on a very small scale and on singletoken patterns where the phrase matcher engine doesnt really have an advantage over the regular token matcher another factor could be that matching on a different attribute eg lower instead of textorth requires creating a new doc during matching that reflects the values of the matched attribute this should be inexpensive but its still one extra object that gets created so a test doc extract january will actually become extract january when matching on lower or even verb propn when matching on pos thats the trick that makes matching on other attributes work some background on how the phrasematcher works and why its mechanism is typically faster when you add doc objects to the phrasematcher it sets flags on the tokens included in the patterns indicating that theyre matching a given pattern it then calls into the regular matcher and adds tokenbased patterns using the previously set flags when youre matching spacy will only have to check the flags and not retrieve any token attributes thats what should make the matching itself significantly faster at scale this actually brings up another approach you could be profiling for comparison using vocabaddflag to set a boolean flag on the respective lexeme entry in the vocab so not the contextsensitive token vocab entries are cached so you should only have to compute the flag once for a lexeme like january however this approach only really makes sense for single tokens so its relatively limiting am i missing something important here or can i trust this analysis on a larger scale if you want to get any meanigful insights you should be benchmarking on at least a mediumsized scale you dont want to be looping over the same small example times and instead benchmark on a dataset that youll only be processing once per test for instance a few hundred documents similar to the data youre actually working with there are caching effects both within spacy but also your cpu differences in memory allocation and so on that can all have an impact finally using spacys cython api directly will always be the fastest so if speed is your number one concern and all you want to optimise for cython would be the way to go
55841087,python spacy and memory consumption,pythonx spacy,for people who land on this in the future i found a hack that seems to work well the idea here is to put everything spacyrelated into a subprocess so all the memory gets released once the subprocess finishes i know its working because i can actually watch the memory get released back to the instance every time the subprocess finishes also the instance no longer crashes xd full disclosure i have no idea why spacy seems to go up in memory overtime ive read all over trying to find a simple answer and all the github issues ive seen claim theyve fixed the issue yet i still see this happening when i use spacy on aws sagemaker instances hope this helps someone i know i spent hours pulling my hair out over this credit to another so answer that explains a bit more about subprocesses in python
55832506,unable to pip install spacy model due to proxy issue,python spacy,you are behind the proxy and are you able to download the model directly from the release in your browser first download the tar file the targz archive is the same file thats downloaded during spacy download and its an installable python package so if you have the file you can also do the following you should then be able to use the model like this you can also download other spacy model in same way or you can also use proxy in pip install but it not work in my case

55597688,speed up spacy tokenizer,pythonx spacy,the main problem open your output file once and leave it open until the end of your script repeatedly closing and reopening and seeking to the end of an ever larger text file is going to be extremely slow read the stopwords into an actual set otherwise youre searching for each token in a long string containing the whole file which accidentally matches partial words and is much much slower than checking for set membership use nlppipe or for tokenization just nlptokenizerpipe to speed up the spacy part a bit with a bunch of short onesentence documents this doesnt seem to make a huge difference it is much faster to tokenize one large document rather than treating each line as an individual document but whether you want to do that depends on how your data is structured if youre just tokenizing you can increase the maximum document size nlpmaxlength if you need to
55582282,add custom generator to spacys class,python class generator spacy,well default attribute is the value which is returned when neither getter nor setter is set hence thats what was returned property or function if you remove the property decorator you can store some static information this way you want to set getter as you did in you answer as this is the operation which is called when you want to get the value of attribute setter would have to be created when changing the value like this setter would be good to provide other value than default though i havent used that approach so far finally i have found a clean way of extending spacy and imo more readable than the one presented example of lemmatization extension as you can see the only thing one has to use is the call overloaded method no need for generator but you could use it as well depending on context of your task

55306056,what is the best way to overcome wrong entity recognision with spacy,pythonx spacy entities,one potential difficulty in your example is that its not very close to natural language the pretrained english models were trained on m words of general web and news text so theyre not always going to perform perfect outofthebox on text with a very different structure while you could update the model with more examples of quantity in your specific texts i think that a rulebased approach might actually be a better and more efficient solution here the example in this blog post is actually very close to what youre trying to do import spacy from spacypipeline import entityruler nlp spacyloadencorewebsm weightspattern likenum true lower in g kg grams kilograms lb lbs pounds patterns label quantity pattern weightspattern ruler entityrulernlp patternspatterns nlpaddpiperuler beforener doc nlpus average was lbs printenttext entlabel for ent in docents us gpe lbs quantity the statistical named entity recognizer respects predefined entities and wil predict around them so if youre adding the entityruler before it in the pipeline your custom quantity entities will be assigned first and will be taken into account when the entity recognizer predicts labels for the remaining tokens note that this example is using the latest version of spacy vx you might also want to add more patterns to cover different constructions for more details and inspiration check out the documentation on the entityruler combining models and rules and the token match pattern syntax

54592834,how not to reload spacy,python spacy,if youre using a model in your application you definitely only want to load it once and then pass around the nlp object this isnt only faster it also ensures consistency if you modify the pipeline to add components or if the vocabulary is updated at runtime you want those changes reflected across your entire application that said the french loading times are unfortunately a bit slow at the moment because they require more static data this should hopefully improve in the upcoming versions you can find more details and solutions in this thread summary cut down the list of tokenizer exceptions yourself and limit them to what you need serve your model via a microservice and expose an api endpoint that accepts text you want to process and returns the jsonformatted predictions this works especially well if you only need the model to extract something from your text

54201004,multithreading with spacy is joblib necessary,python spacy,based on an answer in spacy github issues we kept the nthreads argument to avoid breaking peoples code but unfortunately the implementation doesnt currently release the gil the way we did in v in v the neural network model is more complicated and more subject to change so we havent implemented it in cython we might at a later date in v you can get an alpha by installing spacynightly the matrix multiplications are now singlethreaded this makes it safe to launch multiple processes for the pipeline so we can look at doing that internally in the meantime the nthreads argument sits idlewhich i agree is confusing but removing it and breaking backwards compatibility seems worse thus to summarize nthreads doesnt work in v what im doing now is using spacy with joblib to read a dataset in minibatches spacy released an example for that spacy multiprocessing and it works perfectly i have a dataset with almost m short text without using the example they released it took almost hours to finish parsing them but using joblib with spacy it took hour and half to finish to reference the readers of this question to spacy multiprocessing example spacy multiprocessing

50703265,how to use a loop to access the word preceding a verb in a sentence using spacy python,pythonx spacy,it seems like the problem here is that youre only looking up the index of the tokentag string value in your list of partofspeech tag strings that youve compiled upfront this always returns the first match so in the case of run your script doesnt actually check the pos before index which would be to but instead the pos before index which is prp consider the following abstract example a better and potentially also much simpler solution would be to just iterate over the token objects and use the tokeni attribute which returns its index in the parent document ideally you want to process the text once store the doc and then index into it later when you need it for example ideally you always want to convert spacys output to plain text as late as possible most of the problems you were trying to solve in your code are things that spacy already does for you for example it gives you the doc object and its views span and token that are performant let you index into them iterate over tokens anywhere and more importantly never destroy any information available in the original text once your output is a single string of text plus whitespace plus other characters youve added you wont be able to recover the original tokens very easily you also wont know which token had whitespace attached and how the individual tokens arewere related to each other for more details on the doc token and span objects see this section in the docs and the api reference which lists the available attributes for each object
50688402,spacy adding pointer to another token in custom component,pointers token spacy,the token object is only a view its sort of like holding a reference to the doc object and an index to the token the span object is like this too this ensures theres a single source of truth and only one copy of the data you can find the definition of the key structs in the spacystructspxd file this defines the attributes of the tokenc struct the doc object then holds an array of these and a length the token objects are created on the fly when you index into the doc the data definition for the doc object can be found in spacytokensdocpxd and the implementation of the token access is in spacytokensdocpyx the way the parse tree is encoded in spacy is a bit unsatisfying ive made an issue about this on the tracker it feels like there should be a better solution what we do is encode the offset of the head relative to the token so if you do docci doccihead youll get a pointer to the head that part is okay the part thats a bit weirder is that we track the left and right edges of the tokens subtree and the number of direct left and right children to get the rightmost or leftmost child we navigate around within this region in practice this actually works pretty well because were dealing with a contiguous block of memory and loops in cython are fast but it still feels a bit janky as far as what youll be able to do as a userif you run your own fork of spacy you can happily define your own data on the structs but then youre running your own fork theres no way to attach real attributes to the doc or token objects as these are defined as clevel types so their structure is defined statically its not dynamic you could subclass the doc but this is quite ugly you need to also subclass this is why we have the underscore attributes and the docuserdata dictionary its really the only way to extend the objects fortunately you shouldnt really face a data redundancy problem nothing is stored on the token objects the definitions of your extensions are stored globally within the underscore class data is stored on the doc object even if it applies to a token again the token is a view it cant own anything so the doc has to note that we have some value assigned to token i if youre defining a treenavigation system id recommend considering defining it as your own cython class so you can use structs if you use native python types itll be pretty slow and pretty large if you pack the data into numpy arrays the representation will be more compact but writing the code will be a pretty miserable experience and the performance is likely to be not great in short define your own types in cython put the data into a struct owned by a cdef class and give the class accessor methods use the underscore attributes to access the data from spacys doc span and token objects if you come up with a compelling api for srl and the data can be coded compactly into the tokenc struct wed consider adding it as native support

49849164,how to add additional currency characters in spacy,python spacy,the u problem first thing first it seems that the interpretation of the u character depends on the platform you are using it doesnt print on a windows machine but it works on a linux machine for completeness i have assumed that you get your text from an html document containing the x escape sequence which should print as in a browser the u character and some other arbitrary symbols we identify as currencies before passing the text content to spacy we can call htmlunescape which will take care of translating x to which in turn is going to be recognized by the default configuration as a currency second if there are symbols that are not recognized as a currency like and for example then we can change the defaults of the language we use to qualify them as currencies that consists in replacing the lexattrgettersiscurrency function by a custom one which holds a list of symbols describing a currency the cad problem for this one a simple solution would be to define a special case we say to the tokenizer that wherever it meets cad this is a special case and it needs to do as instructed by us we can set the iscurrency flag amongst other things note that this is not perfect as you may get false positives imagine a document from an canadian company selling cad drawing services so this is good but not great if we want to be more precise we can create a matcher object that will look for patterns like currencyspacenumber or numberspacecurrency and associate the money entity with it and you apply it to your doc object with matcherdoc the op key makes the pattern optional by allowing it to match or times the full code this gives the expected

49121064,feeding spacy ner model negative examples to improve training,python spacy,yes its possible to learn from the negative examples its implemented in spacy because its a key feature of our commercial annotation tool prodigy to mark a span as not person you can makes its label person that should be all you need to do theres currently no easy way to encode constraints like not person and not org you would have to customise the cost functions within spacysyntaxnerpyx the model can learn from annotations like not person because spacys ner and parser both use transitionbased imitation learning algorithms at each word were trying to predict which action to take to transform the current state the supervision comes from an oracle that tells us which actions will introduce new errors if we know that some span of text isnt a person the oracle can use that to mark some of the actions as costly well have multiple zerocost actions but thats normal it happens a lot in the normal training anyway you can learn more about how the entity recogniser works in this video

48668336,how do i find the first token after an arbitrary character offset in a spacy document,spacy,question token offset for any object in spacy there is a text field so tokens and documents can be used with this raw text field in addition spacy provides two ways to get offsets for tokens i the index in the list of tokens idx the raw char offset of the text so in your example i believe you just want something like the following question find without loop sadly i do not believe there is any other interface on the document level that allows for finding tokens via char offset
48572541,spacy sentence tokenization error on hebrew,python spacy,spacys hebrew coverage is currently quite minimal it currently only has word tokenization for hebrew which roughly splits on white space with some extra rules and exceptions the sentence tokenizationboundary detection that you want requires a more sophisticated grammatical parsing of the sentence in order to determine where one sentence ends and another begins these models require a large amount of labeled training data so are available for a smaller number of languages than have tokenization heres the list the initial message is telling you that it can do tokenization which doesnt require a model and then the error youre getting is the result of not having a model to split sentences do ner or pos etc you might look at this list for other resources for hebrew nlp if you find enough labeled data in the right format and youre feeling ambitious you could train your own hebrew spacy model using the overview described here

47643438,why does my custom spacy entity type get detected,namedentityrecognition spacy,this is unexpected behavior i opened it as spacy issue custom entity labels are erroneously detected
47582609,trivial example using spacy matcher not working,spacy,when using the matcher keep in mind that each dictionary in the pattern represents one individual token this also means that the matches it finds depends on how spacy tokenizes your text by default spacys english tokenizer will split your example text like this stays one token which objectively is probably quite reasonable an ip address could be considered a word so the match pattern that expects parts of it to be individual tokens wont match in order to change this behaviour you could customise the tokenizer with an additional rule that tells spacy to split periods between numbers however this might also produce other unintended side effects so a better approach in your case would be to work with the token shape available as the tokenshape attribute the shape is a string representation of the token that describes the individual characters and whether they contain digits uppercaselowercase characters and punctuation the ip address shape looks like this you can either just filter your document and check that tokenshape dddddddd or use the shape as a key in your match pattern for a single token to find sentences or phrases containing tokens of that shape
47561572,assertionerror on trying to add new entity using matcher on spacy,namedentityrecognition spacy,i believe your first code fails because you have not added an entity label for email the second code works because event is a preexisting entity type the documentation is not very clear on what the first argument of the matcheradd method actually does but it adds an entity label for you here are two alternatives that should work and clear up the confusion alternative alternative im not sure why youd want to do it this way because you end up with two entity labels serving essentially the same purpose but provided just for illustration purposes
47443976,formatting training dataset for spacy ner,json format trainingdata namedentityrecognition spacy,it wasnt clear from your question whether youre also asking about the csv extraction so ill just assume this is not the problem if it is this should be pretty easy to achieve using the csv module if the csv data is messy and contains a bunch of stuff combined in one string you might have to call split on it and do it the hacky way if youre able to extract the sentence and data column in a format like this youre actually very close to spacys training format already it seems like your data counts the end character differently and with an offset of compared to spacy so youll have to adjust this by subtracting im probably making this a lot more verbose than it should be but i hope this makes it easier to follow this should give you training data that looks like this
47397556,spacy isspace flag doesnt work,spacy,the problem here is that each dictionary in the match pattern describes an actual existing token so isspace false will match any token that is not a whitespace character for example a token with the text dog or or anything really there is no way for the matcher to match on the absence of a token i just tried your example and by default spacys tokenizer splits share into only two tokens share as the matcher steps through the tokens it wont match as its looking for a currency symbol a nonspace character a digit a bunch of other tokens so in order to match on more specific parts of the token share like the number the forward slash and share youll have to make sure that spacy splits those into separate tokens you can do this by customising the tokenization rules and adding a new infix rule that splits tokens on characters this will result in share share which will be matched by your pattern btw some background on whitespace tokens during tokenization spacy splits tokens on single whitespace characters those characters wont be available as individual tokens but to make sure that no information is lost they can be accessed via the textwithws attribute however if there is more than one whitespace character present spacy will preserve those as tokens which will return true for isspace all other tokens will return false for isspace
47396158,spacy says dependency parser not loaded,spacy,i think the problem here is quite simple when you call this spacy will load the english language class containing the language data and specialcase rules but no model data and weights which enable the parser tagger and entity recognizer to make predictions this is by design because spacy has no way of knowing if you want to load in model data and if so which package so if you want to load an english model youll have to use spacyload which will take care of loading the data and putting together the language and processing pipeline under the hood spacyload will look for an installed model package called encorewebsm load it and check the models meta data to determine which language the model needs in this case english and which pipeline it supports in this case tagger parser and ner it then initialises an instance of english creates the pipeline loads in the binary data from the model package and returns the object so you can call it on your text see this section for a more detailed explanation of this
47352016,spacy model types and available functionality mapping,spacy,syntax refers to the dependency parse all all related linguistic features and properties for example tokendep tokenhead docnounchunks or docsents essentially everything that requires the dependency parse see this page for a quick overview vocabulary means that the vocab is prepopulated with a number of the most frequent words if the model doesnt come with a vocab all tokens will be outofvocabulary and return true for isoov larger models typically also ship with larger vocabulary the sm models should also ship with a basic vocabulary of the most frequent words but there might be an issue with the way some of the data is currently set which should be fixed in the next update to the models
47295316,importerror no module named spacyen,python spacy,yes i can confirm that your solution is correct the version of spacy you downloaded from pip is v which includes a lot of new features but also a few changes to the api one of them is that all language data has been moved to a submodule spacylang to keep thing cleaner and better organised so instead of using spacyen you now import from spacylangen however its also worth mentioning that what you download when you run spacy download en is not the same as spacylangen the language data shipped with spacy includes the static data like tokenization rules stop words or lemmatization tables the en package that you can download is a shortcut for the statistical model encorewebsm it includes the language data as well as binary weight to enable spacy to make predictions for partofspeech tags dependencies and named entities instead of just downloading en id actually recommend using the full model name which makes it much more obvious whats going on python m spacy download encorewebsm nlp spacyloadencorewebsm when you call spacyload spacy does the following find the installed model named encorewebsm a package or shortcut link read its metajson and check which language its using in this case spacylangen and how its processing pipeline should look in this case tagger parser and ner initialise the language class and add the pipeline to it load in the binary weights from the model data so pipeline components like the tagger parser or entity recognizer can make predictions see this section in the docs for more details
47183876,spacy envectorsweblg vs encoreweblg,spacy,the envectorsweblg package has exactly every vector provided by the original glove model the encoreweblg model uses the vocabulary from the vx encoreweblg model which from memory pruned out all entries which occurred fewer than times in a billion word dump of reddit comments in theory most of the vectors that were removed should be things that the spacy tokenizer never produces however earlier experiments with the full glove vectors did score slightly higher than the current ner model so its possible were actually missing out on something by losing the extra vectors ill do more experiments on this and likely switch the lg model to include the unpruned vector table especially now that we have the md model which strikes a better compromise than the current lg package
46981137,tokenizing using pandas and spacy,python pythonx pandas tokenize spacy,ive never used spacy nltk has always gotten the job done for me but from glancing at the documentation it looks like this should work note that nlp by default runs the entire spacy pipeline which includes partofspeech tagging parsing and named entity recognition you can significantly speed up your code by using nlptokenizerx instead of nlpx or by disabling parts of the pipeline when you load the model eg nlp spacyloaden parserfalse entityfalse

44176829,python spacy error runtimeerror language not supported,python dictionary entity spacy,the problem here is that spacyload currently expects either a language id eg en or a shortcut link to a model that tells spacy where to find the data because spacy cant find a shortcut link it assumes that mymodel is a language which obviously doesnt exist you can set up a link for your model like this this will create a symlink in the spacydata directory so you should run it with admin permissions alternatively if youve created a model package that can be installed via pip you can simply install and import it and then call its load method with no arguments in some cases this way of loading models is actually more convenient as its cleaner and lets you debug your code more easily for example if a model doesnt exist python will raise an importerror immediately similarly if loading fails you know theres likely a problem with the models own loading and meta btw im one of the spacy maintainers and i agree that the way spacyload currently works is definitely unideal and confusing were looking forward to finally changing this with the next major release were very close to releasing the first alpha of v which will solve this problem more elegantly and will also include a lot of improvements to the training process and documentation

43046571,can we use spacy with mxnet,spacy mxnet,spacy and mxnet serialize their models differently so they are not directly compatible you can leverage the pretrained models of spacy as part of a preprocessing step for your text data though and then feed into an mxnet model aim to get your text data into an ndarray format using mxndarray also take a look at mxnets model zoo which contains a number of models for nlp tasks wordvec embedding being one example

37047872,how is spacyio using multi threading without gil,python multithreading gil spacy,i need to write up a proper blog post on this the tldr is that spacy is implemented in cython a pythonlike language that transpiles into c or c and ultimately produces a python extension you can read more about releasing the gil with cython here heres the implementation of the pipe method in spacy the actual mechanics of the multithreading are super simple because nlp is often embarrassingly parallel every document is parsed independently so we just need to make a prange loop over a stream of texts implementing the parser in a multithreaded way was quite hard though to use multithreading effectively you need to release the gil and not reacquire it this means making no use of python objects not raising exceptions etc when you create a python object lets say a list you need to increment its reference count which is stored globally this means acquiring the gil theres no way around that but if youre in a c extension and you just want to say put an integer on the stack or make a call to malloc or free you dont need to acquire the gil so if you write the program at that level using only c and c constructs you can release the gil ive been writing statistical parsers in cython for a few years now before spacy i had an implementation for my academic research getting the entire parsing loop written without the gil was hard by late i had the machine learning hash table outer parsing loop and most of the feature extraction as nogil code but the state object had a complicated interface and was implemented as a cdef class i couldnt create this object or store it in a container without acquiring the gil the breakthrough came when i figured out an undocumented way to write a c class in cython this allowed me to hollow out the existing cdef class that controlled the parser state i proxied its interface to the inner c class method by method this way i could keep the code working and make sure i didnt introduce any subtle bugs into the feature calculation you can see the inner class here if you navigate around the git history of this file you can see the patches where i implemented the pipe method

72135860,add custom ner to spacy pipeline,python namedentityrecognition spacy,its not clear from the details in the question but my guess is that your cryptonlp ner depends on a separate tokvec component thats not being included when you source since this tokvec wont be shared its easiest to modify the ner component to include a standalone copy of the tokvec which is called replacing listeners if cryptonlp has nlppipenames as tokvec ner then this should replace the listener before loading it into the second pipeline so its now a standalone component cryptonlpreplacelistenerstokvec ner modeltokvec nlpaddpipener sourcecryptonlp namecryptoner beforener
