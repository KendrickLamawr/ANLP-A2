78685093,alternative to receptive field in transformers and what factors impact it,nlp huggingfacetransformers receptivefield,how do you understand whether one architecture is more optimal to use versus another having a set of text documents with unique properties for modern transformerbased language models lms there are some empirical scaling laws such as the chinchilla scaling laws wikipedia that essentially say that larger deeper models with more layers ie with more parameters tend to perform better so far most lms seem to roughly follow chinchilla scaling there is another kind of scaling which is closer to a receptive field that i talk about below do you guys have something similar in nlp kind of transformerbased lms can be thought to have a receptive field similar to cnn layers as the attention mechanism in the transformer operates on a predefined context window or context length which is the maximum number of tokens the layer can look at attend to at any given time similar to a cnn kernel however with the introduction of new positional encoding pe approaches such as rotary positional encoding rope and modified attention architectures like sliding window attention swa this is not strictly accurate scaling in terms of context length is of much interest but usually it is very difficult to scale transformers this way because of attention being a mathcalon on operation so usually researchers go towards deeper architectures with more parameters overparameterization that can allow the model to memorize as much of the large training corpus as it can overfitting so that it can perform reasonably well when finetuned for most downstream tasks that have at least some representative examples in the training corpus

78612251,how do we addmodify the normalizer in a pretrained huggingface tokenizer,python nlp largelanguagemodel huggingfacetokenizers,this looks like a bug the v tokenizer has a normalizer by default which can be seen by looking at the mistralvtokenizerjson file after modifying the backendtokenizernormalizer object the modification are saved to the tokenizerjson file in the v version the mistralvtokenizerjson file has no value for the normalizer modifying the normalizer and saving the model does write the changes to the json file but it is not getting picked up on reload using autotokenizerfrompretrained i am not sure why but it is entirely possible the tokenizermodel file indicates no normalizer is the default and it simply does not load it however you can get the tokenizer to load correctly with the custom normalizer by instantiating the matched tokenizer class explicitly and passing in the tokenizermodel and tokenizerjson paths along with the values from the tokenizerconfigjson file in this case it is the llamatokenizerfast class from transformers import autotokenizer llamatokenizerfast addedtoken from tokenizersnormalizers import sequence replace prepend load modify and save tok autotokenizerfrompretrainedmistralaimistralbv tokbackendtokenizernormalizer sequence prepend replace replacefoo bar replace n toksavepretrainedmistralbvcustom read in config construct the addedtoken objects with openmistralbvcustomtokenizerconfigjson as fp config jsonloadfp configaddedtokensdecoder intk addedtokenv for k v in configpopaddedtokensdecoderitems load from saved files tokcustom llamatokenizerfast mistralbvcustomtokenizermodel mistralbvcustomtokenizerjson config teststr i foo youhello world print jointokcustombatchdecodetokcustomteststrinputids prints i bar you hello world if you dont want to specify the tokenizer class explicitly you can load the model the the autotokenizer and then load it again using from the resulting class it is a hacky workaround

77182311,question about datacollator throwing a key error in hugging face,python pytorch nlp huggingfacetransformers huggingfacetokenizers,the actual issue is in your seqseqtrainingarguments which is leading the error in your datacollator reason the trainer is by default removing any unknown columns not present in the models forward method from your data when you are providing a custom datacollator as a result even though each sample in your traindataset has all the keys when you send that to datacollator the trainer automatically removes the unknown columns solution you need to include an argument in your training arguments like the following the removeunusedcolumnsfalse would prevent the default behaviour and youd get the entire data in datacollator this issue would be useful for further reference

77116207,what is the correct approach to evaluate huggingface models on the masked language modeling task,machinelearning nlp huggingfacetransformers huggingface,as pointed out in the linked post this is a warning to indicate that those weights are not used this is raised since youre loading a model that has its pooler weights initialised bertbasecased but arent used by a maskedlm model the bertpooler weights are typically used for classification tasks such as bertforsequenceclassification for bertbasecased the model was also trained on the next sentence prediction nsp task so the pooler weights are also trained as pointed out in this github comment after passing a sentence through the model the representation corresponding to the first token in the output is used for finetuning on tasks like squad and glue so the pooler layer does precisely that applies a linear transformation over the representation of the first token the linear transformation is trained while using the next sentence prediction nsp strategy in fact whenever initialising the model with the next sentence prediction task the warning isnt raised from transformers import automodelformaskedlm automodelfornextsentenceprediction automodelforpretraining raises a warning automodelformaskedlmfrompretrainedbertbasecased doesnt raise a warning automodelfornextsentencepredictionfrompretrainedbertbasecased doesnt raise a warning initialised with both mlm nsp automodelforpretrainingfrompretrainedbertbasecased since youre interested in masked language modelling mlm you can disregard the warning since this isnt used for this task for the masked language modelling task you should initialise using automodelformaskedlm since this includes the appropriate head to predict the masked token this forum post has further details about the differences in initialisations
76766594,is examples a default output variable for huggingface transformers library,nlp huggingfacetransformers nlpquestionanswering,to help you understand we first have to clarify that map does not have the called function preprocessfunction as an argument but the function itself preprocessfunction so basically what map does is for a given dataset here squad execute a function preprocessfunction on every batch batchedtrue with a default batch size of so what this means is that map will process the whole dataset squad in chunks batches of items at a time so for every batch a sublist of examples from the dataset the function is called very simplified under the hood map does something like this chop squad in sublists batches of examples each process each batch ie passing the examples to the function put the results of the function back into the resulting dataset as a reference point it might be useful for you to read up on the builtin map in python which works similarly on iterables it is also a concept that returns in other programming languages so it is good to know

76571812,multiclass text classification using hugging face models,python nlp huggingfacetransformers huggingface,the main reason why youre not getting the neutral label is because the model that youre using textattackbertbaseuncasedimdb huggingface link here has been trained on the imdb dataset which is binary classification dataset in other words the model only has two final layers and will only output a prediction between two outputs positive or negative you can see more info about the dataset here as you can clearly see its a binary classification dataset so the model trained on it does not allow for different outputs if you pass it three or more labels as you did with negativeneutralpositive it will only consider the first two and ignore the others the model is set such that the first label is negative and the second is positive irrespective of what you set so your neutral is a positive label as it takes the second position even if you set the labels to random words such as hellothere then your hello label will signify a negative score first place and there a positive score second place be careful because if you set your labels to positivenegative then a positive review first item will effectively be negative one this is just how the model youre using is set up hope this makes sense

72355671,huggingface longformer case sensitive tokenizer,python nlp huggingfacetransformers textclassification huggingfacetokenizers,in my opinion it is better not to modify tokenization schemes of pretrained transformers they were pretrained with a certain vocabulary and changing it may lead to their deterioration if you still want to make the system insensitive to capitalization and if you want to use the same model and the same tokenizer without modifying them too much then just lowercasing the input data is a sensible strategy however if you are willing to spend resources on updating the model and the tokenizer you can do the following modify the tokenizer add a lowercase normalizer into its pipeline optionally modify the vocabulary of the tokenizer drop the unused words that contain uppercase characters and maybe add some lowercase words the embedding and output layers of the model should be modified accordingly and there is no standardized code for this so such manipulations are not recommended unless you understand well what you are doing still such manipulations could improve model performance finetune the model with the original masked language modelling task on a large dataset using the updated tokenizer this will make the neural network better aware of the new lowercase texts that it may discover this will make the system better adapted to uncased texts but it will cost you time to write the code for updating the vocabulary and computational resources to finetune the model

66244123,why use multiheaded attention in transformers,nlp transformermodel attentionmodel,transformers were originally proposed as the title of attention is all you need implies as a more efficient seqseq model ablating the rnn structure commonly used til that point however in pursuing this efficiency a single headed attention had reduced descriptive power compared to rnn based models multiple heads were proposed to mitigate this allowing the model to learn multiple lowerscale feature maps as opposed to one allencompasing map in these models the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions this makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions in the transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attentionweighted positions an effect we counteract with multihead attention attention is all you need as such multiple attention heads in a single layer in a transformer is analogous to multiple kernels in a single layer in a cnn they have the same architecture and operate on the same featurespace but since they are separate copies with different sets of weights they are hence free to learn different functions in a cnn this may correspond to different definitions of visual features and in a transformer this may correspond to different definitions of relevance for example architecture input layer kernelhead layer kernelhead cnn image diagonal edgedetection horizontal edgedetection transformer sentence attends to next word attends from verbs to their direct objects notes there is no guarantee that these are human interpretable but in many popular architectures they do map accurately onto linguistic concepts while no single head performs well at many relations we find that particular heads correspond remarkably well to particular relations for example we find heads that find direct objects of verbs determiners of nouns objects of prepositions and objects of possesive pronouns what does bert look at an analysis of berts attention

62302499,huggingface bert which bert flavor is the fastest to train for debugging,machinelearning nlp huggingfacetransformers bertlanguagemodel,i think generally using a specific model for debugging can be critical and depends entirely on the kind of debugging you want to perform specifically consider the aspect of tokenization since each model also carries their own derivation of the basetokenizer class therefore any specifics of the respective model will only show up if you also use this specific tokenizer say eg you want to debug a later roberta implementation by using distilbert for debugging anything specific to robertas tokenization will not be the same in distilbert which uses berts tokenizer similarly any specifics to the training process might completely screw up the training from anecdotal evidence i had models train to completion and convergence with roberta but not on bert which makes the proposed solution of using different models for debugging a potentially dangerous substitution albert again has properties different from any of the above mentioned models but analogously the mentioned aspects still hold if you want to prototype services and simply require a model for in between i think both of the models suggested by you would do just fine and there should be only a minor difference in loadingsaving depending on the exact number of model parameters but keep in mind that inference time for applications is also something that is worth considering unless you are absolutely sure that there will not be any noticeable difference in the execution time at least make sure that you are testing with the full model as well

68383634,cuda error cublasstatusinvalidvalue error when training bert model using huggingface,python pytorch sentimentanalysis bertlanguagemodel,i suggest trying out couple of things that can possibly solve the error as shown in this forum one possible solution is to lower the batch size of how you load data since it might be a memory error if that does not work then i suggest as shown in this github issue to update to a new version of pytorch cuda that fixes a matrix multiplication bug that releases this same error that your code could be doing hence as shown in this forum you can update pytorch to the nightly pip wheel or use the cuda or conda binaries you can find information on such installations on the pytorch home page where it mentions how to install pytorch if none of that works then the best thing to do is to run a smaller version of the process on cpu and recreate the error when running it on cpu instead of cuda you will get a more useful traceback that can solve your error edit based on comments you have a matrix error in your model the problem stems in your forward func then the model bert outputs a tensor that has torchsize which means if you put it in the linear layer you have it will error since that linear layer requires input of bc you initialized it as nnlinear in order to make the error disappear you need to either do some transformation on the tensor or initialize another linear layer as shown below sarthak jain

78267762,quantization and torchdtype in huggingface transformer,huggingfacetransformers huggingface quantization,gptq is a posttraining quantization method this means a gptq model was created in full precision and then compressed not all values will be in bits unless every weight and activation layer has been quantized the gptq method does not do this specifically gptq adopts a mixed intfp quantization scheme where weights are quantized as int while activations remain in float as these values need to be multiplied together this means that during inference weights are dequantized on the fly and the actual compute is performed in float in a hugging face quantization blog post from aug they talk about the possibility of quantizing activations as well in the room for improvement section however at that time there were no open source implementations since then they have released quanto this does support quantizing activations it looks promising but it is not yet quicker than other quantization methods it is in beta and the docs say to expect breaking changes in the api and serialization there are some accuracy and perplexity benchmarks which look pretty good with most models surprisingly at the moment it is slower than bit models due to lack of optimized kernels but that seems to be something theyre working on so this does not just apply to gptq you will find yourself using float with any of the popular quantization methods at the moment for example activationaware weight quantization awq also preserves in full precision a small percentage of the weights that are important for performance this is a useful blog post comparing gptq with other quantization methods

77159136,efficiently using hugging face transformers pipelines on gpu with large datasets,python gpu huggingfacetransformers huggingfacedatasets,i think you can ignore this message i found it being reported on different websites this year but if i get it correctly this github issue on the huggingface transformers shows that the warning can be safely ignored in addition batching or using datasets might not remove the warning or automatically use the resources in the best way you can do callcount in here to ignore the warning as explained by martin weyssow above how can i modify my code to batch my data and use parallel computing to make better use of my gpu resources you can add batching like this and most importantly you can experiment with the batch size that will result to the highest gpu usage possible on your device and particular task huggingface provides here some rules to help users figure out how to batch making the best resourcegpu usage possible might take some experimentation and it depends on the use case you work on every time what does this warning mean and why should i use a dataset for efficiency this means the gpu utilization is not optimal because the data is not grouped together and it is thus not processed efficiently using a dataset from the huggingface library datasets will utilize your resources more efficiently however it is not so easy to tell what exactly is going on especially considering that we dont know exactly how the data looks like what the device is and how the model deals with the data internally the warning might go away by using the datasets library but that does not necessarily mean that the resources are optimally used what code or function or library should be used with hugging face transformers here is a code example with pipelines and the datasets library it mentions that using iterables will fill your gpu as fast as possible and batching might also help with computational time improvements in your case it seems you are doing a relatively small poc doing inference for under documents with a medium size model so i dont think you need to use pipelines i assume the sentiment analysis model is a classifier and you want to keep using pandas as shown in the post so here is how you can combine both this is usually fast enough for my experiments and prints no warnings about the resources as soon as your inference starts either with this snippet or with the datasets library code you can run nvidiasmi in a terminal and check what the gpu usage is and play around with the parameters to optimize it beware that running the code on your local machine with a gpu vs running it on a larger machine eg a linux server with perhaps a more powerful gpu might lead to different performance and might need different tuning if you wish to run the code for larger document collections you can split the data in order to avoid gpu memory errors locally or in order to speed up the inference with concurrent runs in a server

76760152,why is unnormalized input added to output in huggingface t model,normalization huggingfacetransformers,t uses residual connectionsskip connections where the input to a layergroup is added to the output of that layer this is done to avoid vanishing gradient problems where the gradients of the loss function become very small as they get backpropagated through layers of the network this makes the network difficult to train effectively this method where the original unmodified input is combined with the output is a unique feature of a prelayernorm version of the transformer model which t employs layer normalization or layernorm is executed before the selfattention and feedforward sublayers unlike the original transformer model where its applied afterwards consequently the output of these sublayers is combined with the original unnormalized input the goal of models like t isnt necessarily to maintain the same scale or magnitude throughout the network but to optimize the learning process and final performance this design choice has been found to improve the performance of the model you can see how they discuss this decision in the exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified texttotext transformer and the t model code in the transformers library reflects these design choices papers with code about t good description of skip connections evolving attention with residual convolutions exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified texttotext transformer

76446228,setting padding token as eos token when using datacollatorforlanguagemodeling from huggingface,pytorch huggingfacetransformers huggingfacetokenizers huggingface huggingfacedatasets,tldr ignoring the eos symbol when training a normal language model is okay so padding the sequence with eos instead of a dedicated pad symbol is okay too in long when using datacollatorforlanguagemodelingtokenizer mlmfalse the maskedlanguage modeling model is off and we are doing casual language modeling ie predicting the next word given the previous consider this now we pad the sequence until its of length tokens when the model learns with causal language model its predicting the next word given the previous ie in most common inference routine the model will stop once the first eos is predicted or all beams in the search during inference produced their first eos during training the model will learn and when you compute the perplexity all the pad symbols are ignored and in this case when you treat the eos as pad you are essentially tell the model even the first eos is not necessary when computing perplexity q is that the right thing to do to ignore even the first eos token when we use eos as a padding token a it depends on your task and what you want the eos to mean for most natural language we have punctuations before eos so eospad doesnt really matter for programming language we have n and or some end of sequence operator so eos isnt that necessary too q then why do we bother to pad a actually thats a good question were padding so that the dotproducts in transformer attentions can be easily computed but there are many cases where pad tokens can be efficiently packed like in rnn iirc not in transformers architecture though but i dont know how much of that is already in pytorchjax underlying library for efficient transformers which will allow us to avoid prepadding inputs from my experience in using huggingface pytorch models if you dont pad the inputs most probably the model will complain when you do a forward pass if only someone fix that mathematically maybe someone did try but its not that common to be largely used by most transformers pretrained model yet

76265747,computing the cosine similarity of embeddings generated by the dolly model on the hugging face hub,python numpy huggingfacetransformers valueerror,theres a couple of things happening here dollyvb gives you multiple embeddings for a given text input where the number of embeddings depends on the input you provide for example while the model provides embeddings also called vectors for the first sentence in dataset it provides embeddings for the subsequent cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors the code you provided tries to compare multiple vectors of one sentence with multiple vectors of another sentence which violates the aforementioned operation that cosine similarity performs therefore before performing the similarity computations we need to condense the embeddings into a single vector the code below uses a technique called vector averaging which simply computes the average of the vectors its required to call npaverage which is used for vector averaging and npnormalize for each sentence individually in dataset the code below runs without error and returns a cosine similarity of for the first comparison where we compare the sentence to itself which is expected moreover the undefined npnan angular difference between the two identical vectors of the first comparison also makes sense

75931144,change the number of layers of a pretrained huggingface pegasus model used for conditional generation,pytorch huggingfacetransformers huggingface,from what i understand you are trying to use a pretrained model from huggingface for inference this model contains different layers encoder layers decoder layers by default for the pretrained model you use if you want to use internal states of the model which is equivalent to ignoring some of the final layers you can create the model with model pegasusforconditionalgenerationfrompretrainedgooglepegasuspubmed and then use the parameter outputhiddenstatestrue of the model inference call and use the embedding from any internal layer but you cannot bypass only intermediate layers since the following layers are dependant on it if you want to change the structure of the network by adding layers you cannot use a pretrained model since the layers you are trying to add would have random weights so you would have to create your new model from the config and train it on data that you have access to you can try to initialize some of the layers of your model with weights from the pretrained one but you wont have good results before training since the model still has some completely random weights

75845842,is the default class in huggingface transformers using pytorch or tensorflow under the hood,python tensorflow pytorch huggingfacetransformers,it depends on how the model is trained and how you load the model most popular models on transformers supports both pytorch and tensorflow and sometimes also jax out maybe something like q so if i use trainer its pytorch a yes most probably the model has pytorch backend and the training loop optimizer loss etc uses pytorch but the trainer isnt the model its the wrapper object q and if i want to use trainer for tensorflow backend models i should use tftrainer not really in the latest version of transformers the tftrainer object is deprecated see it is recommended that you use keras sklearnstyle fit training if you are using a model with tensorflow backend q why does my script keep printing out tensorflow related errors shouldnt trainer be using pytorch only try checking your transformers version most probably you are using an outdated version that uses some deprecated objects eg textdataset see how to resolve only integer tensors of a single element can be converted to an index error when creating a dataset to finetune gpt model in the later versions most probably pip install transformers the trainer shouldnt be activating tf warnings and using tftrainer would have raised warnings to suggest users to use keras instead
75746687,is it possible to save the trainingvalidation loss in a list during training in huggingface,machinelearning pytorch huggingfacetransformers huggingface,one way of proceeding might be the following you can access training and evaluation losses via the trainerstateloghistory object after training an example below accuracy and f might be ignored as they derive from the specific computemetrics function passed as parameter to the trainer instance it is a list of dicts which contains some logged values per logged step among the keys of the different dictionaries you should find loss and evalloss whose values you might retrieve as follows analogously for validation losses the loss is computed via the computeloss method of the trainer class which you might override for custom behaviour as described at

75710776,huggingface gpt loss understanding,pytorch huggingfacetransformers gpt,the default loss function is negative loglikelihood the actual model output is not the token city but a categorical distribution over the entire k vocabulary depending on the generation strategy you either sample from these distributions or take the most probable token the token city apparently the most probable one gets some probability and the loss is then minus the logarithm of this probability loss close to zero would mean the token would get a probability close to one however the token distribution also considers many plausible but less likely followups loss corresponds to the probability of exp approximately it seems small but in a k vocabulary it is approximately times more probable than a random guess you can try to finetune the model to be absolutely sure that city will follow with probability but it would probably break other language modeling capabilities

72214408,why does huggingface t tokenizer ignore some of the whitespaces,huggingfacetransformers huggingfacetokenizers sentencepiece,the behaviour is explained by how the tokenize method in ttokenizer strips tokens by default what one can do is adding the token n as a special token to the tokenizer because the special tokens are never seperated it works as expected it is a bit hacky but seems to work then it tokenizes the n without skipping any occurences note that addedtoken is important because somehow the following does not work edit after spending more time on it i actually found a way to add it as a normal token without using special tokens the main reason for the issue is the normalization process that happens behind the scenes even before the tokenization when you add a new token you can specify if it should be normalized or not by setting normalize to false you avoid the tokenizer from stripping consecutive occurrences of the added token you can find more information on this link

70149699,transformers barttokenizeraddtokens doesnt work as id expect for suffixes,python huggingfacetransformers,the short answer is that theres behavior bug in the handling of added tokens for bart and roberta gpt etc that explicitly strips spaces from the tokens adjacent both left and right to the added tokens location i dont see a simple workaround to this added tokens are handled differently in the transformers tokenizer code the text is first split using a trie to identify any tokens in the added tokens list see tokenizationutilspytokenize after finding any added tokens in the text the remainder is then tokenized using the existing vocabbpe encoding scheme see tokenizationgptpytokenize the added tokens are added to the selfuniquenosplittokens list which prevents them from being broken down further into smaller chunks the code that handles this see tokenizationutilspytokenize explicitly strips the spaces from the tokens to the left and right you could manually remove them from the no split list but then they may be broken down into smaller subcomponents note that for special tokens if you add the token inside of the addedtoken class you can set the lstrip and rstrip behaviors but this isnt available for nonspecial tokens see for the else statement where the spaces are stripped

69025750,how to finetune huggingface bert model for text classification,machinelearning huggingfacetransformers transferlearning,fine tuning approach there are multiple approaches to finetune bert for the target tasks further pretraining the base bert model custom classification layers on top of the base bert model being trainable custom classification layers on top of the base bert model being nontrainable frozen note that the bert base model has been pretrained only for two tasks as in the original paper bert pretraining of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding pretraining bert we pretrain bert using two unsupervised tasks task masked lm task next sentence prediction nsp hence the base bert model is like halfbaked which can be fully baked for the target domain st way we can use it as part of our custom model training with the base trainable nd or nottrainable rd st approach how to finetune bert for text classification demonstrated the st approach of further pretraining and pointed out the learning rate is the key to avoid catastrophic forgetting where the pretrained knowledge is erased during learning of new knowledge we find that a lower learning rate such as e is necessary to make bert overcome the catastrophic forgetting problem with an aggressive learn rate of e the training set fails to converge probably this is the reason why the bert paper used e e e and e for finetuning we use a batch size of and finetune for epochs over the data for all glue tasks for each task we selected the best finetuning learning rate among e e e and e on the dev set note that the base model pretraining itself used higher learning rate bertbaseuncased pretraining the model was trained on cloud tpus in pod configuration tpu chips total for one million steps with a batch size of the sequence length was limited to tokens for of the steps and for the remaining the optimizer used is adam with a learning rate of e and a weight decay of learning rate warmup for steps and linear decay of the learning rate after will describe the st way as part of the rd approach below fyi tfdistilbertmodel is the bare base model with the name distilbert nd approach huggingface takes the nd approach as in finetuning with native pytorchtensorflow where tfdistilbertforsequenceclassification has added the custom classification layer classifier on top of the base distilbert model being trainable the small learning rate requirement will apply as well to avoid the catastrophic forgetting implementation of the nd approach rd approach basics please note that the images are taken from a visual guide to using bert for the first time and modified tokenizer tokenizer generates the instance of batchencoding which can be used like a python dictionary and the input to the bert model batchencoding holds the output of the encodeplus and batchencode methods tokens attentionmasks etc this class is derived from a python dictionary and can be used as a dictionary in addition this class exposes utility methods to map from wordcharacter space to token space parameters data dict dictionary of listsarraystensors returned by the encodebatchencode methods inputids attentionmask etc the data attribute of the class is the tokens generated which has inputids and attentionmask elements inputids inputids the input ids are often the only required parameters to be passed to the model as input they are token indices numerical representations of tokens building the sequences that will be used as input by the model attentionmask attention mask this argument indicates to the model which tokens should be attended to and which should not if the attentionmask is the token id is ignored for instance if a sequence is padded to adjust the sequence length the padded words should be ignored hence their attentionmask are special tokens berttokenizer addes special tokens enclosing a sequence with cls and sep cls represents classification and sep separates sequences for question answer or paraphrase tasks sep separates the two sentences to compare berttokenizer clstoken str optional defaults to clsthe classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification classification of the whole sequence instead of pertoken classification it is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens septoken str optional defaults to septhe separator token which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences eg two sequences for sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering it is also used as the last token of a sequence built with special tokens a visual guide to using bert for the first time show the tokenization cls the embedding vector for cls in the output from the base model final layer represents the classification that has been learned by the base model hence feed the embedding vector of cls token into the classification layer added on top of the base model bert pretraining of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding the first token of every sequence is always a special classification token cls the final hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification tasks sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence we differentiate the sentences in two ways first we separate them with a special token sep second we add a learned embedding to every token indicating whether it belongs to sentence a or sentence b the model structure will be illustrated as below vector size in the model distilbertbaseuncased each token is embedded into a vector of size the shape of the output from the base model is batchsize maxsequencelength embeddingvectorsize this accords with the bert paper about

66820943,how to get word embeddings from the pretrained transformers,python tensorflow huggingfacetransformers transferlearning transformermodel,joining subword embeddings into words for word labeling is not how this problem is usually approached the usual approach is the opposite keep the subwords as they are but adjust the labels to respect the tokenization of the pretrained model one of the reasons is that the data is typically in batches when merging subwords into words every sentence in the batch would end up having a different length which would require processing each sentence independently and pad the batch again this would be slow also if you do not average the neighboring embeddings you get more finegrained information from the loss function which tells explicitly what subword is responsible for an error when tokenizing using sentencepiece you can get the indices in the original string from transformers import xlmrobertatokenizerfast tokenizer xlmrobertatokenizerfastfrompretrainedxlmrobertabase tokenizerdeception master returnoffsetsmappingtrue this returns the following dictionary with the offsets you can find out if the subword corresponds to a word that you want to label there are various strategies that could be used for encoding the labels the easiest one is just to copy the label to every subword a more fancy way would be using schemes used in named entity recognition such as iob tagging that explicitly says what is the begging of the labeled segment

64383443,whats difference robertamodel robertasequenceclassification hugging face,huggingfacetransformers,i think its easiest to understand if we have a look at the actual implementation where i randomly chose robertamodel and robertaforsequenceclassification as an example however the conclusion is valid for all other models too you can find the implementation for robertaforsequenceclassification here which looks roughly like this class robertaforsequenceclassificationrobertapretrainedmodel authorizedmissingkeys rpositionids def initself config superinitconfig selfnumlabels confignumlabels selfroberta robertamodelconfig addpoolinglayerfalse selfclassifier robertaclassificationheadconfig selfinitweights def forward as we can see there is no indication about the pretraining here and it simply adds another linear layer on top the implementation of the robertaclassificationhead can be found a bit further down namely here class robertaclassificationheadnnmodule head for sentencelevel classification tasks def initself config superinit selfdense nnlinearconfighiddensize confighiddensize selfdropout nndropoutconfighiddendropoutprob selfoutproj nnlinearconfighiddensize confignumlabels def forwardself features kwargs x features take token equiv to cls x selfdropoutx x selfdensex x torchtanhx x selfdropoutx x selfoutprojx return x so to answer your question these models come without any pretrained additional layers on top and you could easily implement them yourself now for the asterisk while it could be easy to wrap this yourself also note that it is an inherited class robertapretrainedmodel this has several advantages the most important one being a consistent design between different implementations sequence classification model sequence tagging model etc further there are some neat functionalities that they are providing like the forward call including extensive parameters padding masking attention output which would cost quite some time to implement last but not least there are existing trained models based on these specific implementations which you can search for on the huggingface model hub there you might find models that are finetuned on a sequence classification task eg this one and then directly load its weights in a robertaforsequenceclassification model if you had your own implementation of a sequence classification model loading and aligning these pretrained weights would be incredibly more complicated i hope this answers your main concern but feel free to elaborate either as comment or new question on any points that have not been addressed

63461262,bert sentence embeddings from transformers,bertlanguagemodel huggingfacetransformers,while the existing answer of jindrich is generally correct it does not address the question entirely the op asked which layer he should use to calculate the cosine similarity between sentence embeddings and the short answer to this question is none a metric like cosine similarity requires that the dimensions of the vector contribute equally and meaningfully but this is not the case for bert weights released by the original authors jacob devlin one of the authors of the bert paper wrote im not sure what these vectors are since bert does not generate meaningful sentence vectors it seems that this is doing average pooling over the word tokens to get a sentence vector but we never suggested that this will generate meaningful sentence representations and even if they are decent representations when fed into a dnn trained for a downstream task it doesnt mean that they will be meaningful in terms of cosine distance since cosine distance is a linear space where all dimensions are weighted equally however that does not mean you can not use bert for such a task it just means that you can not use the pretrained weights outofthebox you can either train a classifier on top of bert which learns which sentences are similar using the cls token or you can use sentencetransformers which can be used in an unsupervised scenario because they were trained to produce meaningful sentence representations

63020991,cannot import name pipline from transformers unknown location,python jupyterlab huggingfacetransformers,in general when you face such an issue that an import is working in one environment script codetestpy but not in the other jupyterlab you need to compare the search path for modules with syspath and the location of the module with modulefile transformersfile in this case when you compare the outputs of syspath of both environments you will notice that usersmyusernamepathtomyprojectcodeenvlibpythonsitepackages is only listed in one and this is exactly the location where the transformers module is loaded from output of transformersfile that means jupyterlab is not using your virtual environment all you need to do is to register your environment for jupyterlab with and jupyterlab will now allow you to select the environment as kernels
62863859,running transformers on docker,huggingfacetransformers,i believe the issue is that docker doesnt store a cache it isnt persistent between runs and hugging face doesnt automatically download the model files without that cache you canshould mount a storage folder like hfcache or something similar in your project directory then set your environment variable in the dockerfile like so then mount the cache directory like this or if youre using pycharm just use the docker run configuration this tells docker to use your local cache file and lets you persist information between docker runs and huggingface can accesscachereuse the downloaded models between runs ive run this locally on docker and it works for me its also good practice to include a requirementstxt file and direct docker to download the contents after resolving this issue i then had to download a couple of dependencies

62422590,do i need to pretokenize the text first before using huggingfaces robertatokenizer different undersanding,huggingfacetransformers huggingfacetokenizers,hugingfaces transformers are designed such that you are not supposed to do any pretokenization roberta uses sentecepiece which has lossless pretokenization ie when you have a tokenized text you should always be able to say how the text looked like before tokenization the which is a weird unicode underscore in the original sentecepiece says that there should be a space when you detokenize as a consequence big and big end up as different tokens of course in this particular context it does not make much sense because it is obviously still the same word but this the price you pay for lossless tokenization and also how roberta was trained bert uses wordpiece which does not suffer from this problem on the other hand the mapping between the original string and the tokenized text is not as straightforward which might be inconvenient eg when you want to highlight something in a usergenerated text

62040309,why we need the initweight function in bert pretrained model in huggingface transformers,python huggingfacetransformers bertlanguagemodel,have a look at the code for frompretrained what actually happens is something like this find the correct base model class to initialise initialise that class with pseudorandom initialisation by using the initweights function that you mention find the file with the pretrained weights overwrite the weights of the model that we just created with the pretrained weights where applicable this ensure that the layers that were not pretrained eg in some cases the final classification layer do get initialised in initweights but dont get overridden
61969783,huggingface bert showing poor accuracy f score pytorch,pytorch huggingfacetransformers bertlanguagemodel,after some digging i found out the main culprit was the learning rate for finetuning bert is extremely high when i reduced my learning rate from to e both my training and test accuracy reached when bert is finetuned all layers are trained this is quite different from finetuning in a lot of other ml models but it matches what was described in the paper and works quite well as long as you only finetune for a few epochs its very easy to overfit if you finetune the whole model for a long time on a small amount of data src best result is found when all the layers are trained with a really small learning rate src
61916760,using huggingface transformers with a non english language,pythonx multilingual huggingfacetransformers,the problem is that pipelines by default load an english model in the case of sentiment analysis this is distilbertbaseuncasedfinetunedsstenglish see here fortunately you can just specify the exact model that you want to load as described in the docs for pipeline from transformers import pipeline pipe pipelinesentimentanalysis model tokenizer keep in mind that these need to be models compatible with the architecture of your respective task the only greek model i could find was nlpauebbertbasegreekuncasedv which seems like a base model to me in that case youd first need to finetune your own model for sentiment analysis and then could load from that checkpoint otherwise you might get questionable results as well

61774933,understanding the hugging face transformers,pretrainedmodel huggingfacetransformers bertlanguagemodel nlpquestionanswering squad,i would formulate it like this the second link basically describes communityaccepted models ie models that serve as the basis for the implemented huggingface classes like bert roberta etc and some related models that have a high aceptance or have been peerreviewed this list has bin around much longer whereas the list in the first link only recently got introduced directly on the huggingface website where the community can basically upload arbitrary checkpoints that are simply considered compatible with the library oftentimes these are additional models trained by practitioners or other volunteers and have a taskspecific finetuning note that al models from pretrainedmodelshtml are also included in the models interface as well if you have a very narrow usecase you might as well check and see if there was already some model that has been finetuned on your specific task in the worst case youll simply end up with the base model anyways
61708486,whats difference between tokenizerencode and tokenizerencodeplus in hugging face,huggingfacetransformers,the main difference is stemming from the additional information that encodeplus is providing if you read the documentation on the respective functions then there is a slight difference forencode converts a string in a sequence of ids integer using the tokenizer and vocabulary same as doing selfconverttokenstoidsselftokenizetext and the description of encodeplus returns a dictionary containing the encoded sequence or sequence pair and additional information the mask for sequence classification and the overflowing elements if a maxlength is specified depending on your specified model and input sentence the difference lies in the additionally encoded information specifically the input mask since you are feeding in two sentences at a time bert and likely other model variants expect some form of masking which allows the model to discern between the two sequences see here since encodeplus is providing this information but encode isnt you get different output results

61306391,running squad script using albert huggingfacetransformers,python deeplearning huggingfacetransformers squad,you can use gradient accumulation steps to compensate for the small batch size essentially the gradient accumulation step parameter is this lets say you want a batchsize of but your gpu can only fit a batch of size so you make two passes of batches each accumulate your gradients and then do the backward pass after batches secondly hyperparameters play a humongous role in deep learning models you will have to try a few sets of parameters to get better accuracy i think reducing the learning rate to the order of e might help here though it is just speculation
60843698,how to define ration of summary with hugging face transformers pipeline,pytorch huggingfacetransformers,note that this answer is based on the documentation for version of transformers it seems that as of yet the documentation on the pipeline feature is still very shallow which is why we have to dig a bit deeper when calling a python object it internally references its own call property which we can find here for the summarization pipeline note that it allows us similar to the underlying bartforconditionalgeneration model to specifiy the minlength and maxlength which is why we can simply call with something like this would give you a summary of about length of the original data but of course you can change that to your liking note that the default value for bartforconditionalgeneration for maxlength is as of now minlength is undocumented but defaults to whereas the summarization pipeline has values minlength and maxlength

60157959,transformers summarization with python pytorch how to get longer output,pytorch huggingfacetransformers pytorchignite,the short answer is yes probably to explain this in a bit more detail we have to look at the paper behind the implementation in table you can clearly see that most of their generated headlines are much shorter than what you are trying to initialize while that alone might not be an indicator that you couldnt generate anything longer we can go even deeper and look at the meaning of the unusedx tokens as described by bert dev jacob devlin since the unusedx tokens were not used they are effectively randomly initialized further the summariazation paper describes position embeddings in the original bert model have a maximum length of we overcome this limitation by adding more position embeddings that are initialized randomly and finetuned with other parameters in the encoder this is a strong indicator that past a certain length they are likely falling back to the default initialization which is unfortunately random the question is whether you can still salvage the previous pretraining and simply finetune to your objective or whether it is better to just start from scratch

75672816,how does gptlike transformers utilize only the decoder to do sequence generation,deeplearning pytorch gpt textgeneration,the input for a decoderonly model like gpt is typically a sequence of tokens just like in an encoderdecoder model however the difference lies in how the input is processed in an encoderdecoder model the input sequence is first processed by an encoder component that produces a fixedsize representation of the input often called the context vector the context vector is then used by the decoder component to generate the output sequence in contrast in a decoderonly model like gpt there is no separate encoder component instead the input sequence is directly fed into the decoder which generates the output sequence by attending to the input sequence through selfattention mechanisms in both cases the input sequence is typically a sequence of tokens that represent the text data being processed the tokens may be words subwords or characters depending on the specific modeling approach and the granularity of the text data being processed
