74125171,why does extracting words using nltk truncate the last s on some ocassions,python pythonx text nlp nltk,this is because you are using the lemmatize method from the wordnetlemmatizer class although the class is called a lemmatizer it uses a special morphy method that actually stems the words instead of lemmatizing them while i dont know what language model youre using my guess is that the wordnetlemmatizer classifies the words with an s at the end as some sort of plural morpheme which ultimately results in a cutoff for more information about the inner workings see the documentation for the wordnetlemmatizer as well as the morphy method of nltk if you do not need the token lemmatization you can omit the process otherwise you could consider using spacy you would need to download a language model of your choice and lemmatize your words using something like this hope this helps

71927697,removing nonenglish words from csv nltk,pandas nlp nltk,generally you should give an example of your dataset what is the previous content of the column tags how are tags separated how is no tags expressed and is there a difference between empty list and nan i assume tags can contain multiple words so that is important also when it comes to removing nonenglish words but for simplicity sake lets assume there are only onewordtags and they are separated by a whitespace so that each rows content is a string also lets assume that empty rows no tags have the default na value for pandas numpynan and since you probably read the file with pandas some values might have been autoconverted to numbers setup drop na rows and tokenize filter by known words always allow nonalpha the main problem in your code probably results from you doing a flat iteration over a nested list you already tokenized so now each row in the pandas series is a list if you modify the iteration to be nested as well as i did in the example the code should run also you should never do string conversion be it astypestr or any other way before removing nas because then nas will become something like nan and will not be removed first drop na to handle empty cells then convert to handle other stuff like numbers etc

71339209,nltk adding negative words for sentiment analysis,machinelearning nlp artificialintelligence nltk,how are you doing the sentiment analysis so far it would help to see samples to know what exactly you are trying to do if you are using some kind of trained model that gives you a sentiment value or sentiment class then it definitely isnt as simple as just telling the model to see those words as negative you would have to retrainfinetune the model of course you could mix the results of the model with your own postediting of the results by checking if there are certain words in the text and if so rate it even lower than the model rating in general i am pretty sure that a trained model yields a better performance than anything rulebased you could build yourself depending if you have available data the best performance would probably be to finetune a pretrained model but for this nltk and spacy arent the bestmost user friendly edit some ways to run toxicity analysis models trained to detect toxicity the most powerful and stateoftheart way to do this analysis would probably be to used pretrained transformer models which were finetuned on the probably best annotated available dataset for this topic which is the one released for the jigsaw toxicity detection challenges in python you can find some models for this on huggingface eg there you also have an api to see how it works and what the model can detect purely rulebased since you have a list of slurs you are probably expected to use more of a rulebased approach a basic approach for assigning a toxicity value to a sentence would be split the tweet into sentences using nltks senttokenize then split each sentence into words using wordtokenize set all words to lowercase count how many toxic words are in the sentence the number of toxic word occurences is the profanity score of that sentence mix rulebased and sentiment analysis since your approach so far seems to be to use a sentiment analysis module you could try to mix the sentiment score you get from nltks sentiment analysis modulevader module with a rule based approach that counts the number of words from the list you should realize that sentiment analysis is not the same as profanity or toxicity detection though if you give something like i am extremely sad to nltks sentiment analysis it will return a very negative score even though the sentence has no profanity or toxicity on the other hand if you give something like i am so fucking happy to the sentiment analysis it will at least detect that this is not too negative which is a benefit compared to a purely rule based approach which would mark this as profanitytoxicity so it makes sense to combine the approaches but doesnt make much sense to just insert the list you have into the sentiment analysis what you could do for example is weight each score as of the overall score first you calculate the sentiment score and then you apply your own rulebased score as described before onto that score to make it lower if any of the slurs occur

64068144,nlp difference between using nltks sentiment analysis and using ml approach,python machinelearning nlp nltk sentimentanalysis,sentimentintensityanalyzer is a tool built specifically for analyzing sentiment it is easy to use but can miss some cases for example a machine learning approach like the one outlined in your link more involved it focuses on creating features often using tfidf but certainly not limited to and then a machine learning is used on top of that this approach relies on availability of good enough and large enough training dataset often feature extraction is the more important part and a simple model like logistic regression is chosen bert is pretrained model that can be fine tuned thought it doesnt have to be i found that fine tuning helps in my experience the main advantages of bert with enough training data bert can be very powerful with enough training data it should be able to get an example in the beginning of my post correctly and this is a huge advantage since bert is already pretrained it might require relatively small number of training samples to give good reasonable results because bert does not require or require a lot less feature engineering it can be fast in terms of ml engineering work to get good initial results the main limitations of bert are learning curve mostly conceptually understanding how it works using bert is not very hard bert is slow to train and predict you pretty much have to use at least a moderate gpu even for a small dataset lack of transparency it is really hard to know why bert based model is suggesting what it is suggesting

52140526,python nltk stemmers never remove prefixes,python nlp nltk stemming porterstemmer,youre right most stemmers only stem suffixes in fact the original paper from martin porter is titled porter m an algorithm for suffix stripping program and possibly the only stemmers that has prefix stemming in nltk are the arabic stemmers but if we take a look at this prefixreplace function it simply removes the old prefix and substitute it with the new prefix but we can do better first do you have a fixed list of prefix and substitutions for the language you need to process lets go with the unfortunately de facto language english and do some linguistics work to find out prefixes in english without much work you can write a prefix stemming function before the suffix stemming from nltk eg now that we have a simplistic prefix stemmer could we do better what if we check if the prefix stemmed words appears in certain list before stemming it we resolve the issue of not stemming away the prefix causing senseless root eg but the porter stem would have still make remove the suffix ed which maymay not be the desired output that one would require esp when the goal is to retain linguistically sound units in the data so depending on the task its sometimes more beneficial to use a lemma more than a stemmer see also nltk words corpus does not contain okay stemmers vs lemmatizers how does spacy lemmatizer works

51746988,internal implementation of nltk pos tagger,nlp nltk spacy,a sentence of one word is still a sentence so from a software engineering point of view i would expect a tagger module to work the same regardless of the length of the sentence from a linguistic point of view thats not the case the word positioning is what seems to be confusing you many pos taggers are based on sequence models such as hmms or crfs these use context feature eg what are the previousnext words in the sentence i think thats what your colleague meant if you only consider the previous one word as context then it doesnt matter how long the sentence is the first word in any sentence has no previous word so the tagger has to learn to deal with that however adding context can change the decision of the tagger lets look at an example using nltk as you can see changing the first word affects the taggers output for the second word as a consequence you should not be removing stopwords before feeding your text into a pos tagger although thats not always true nltk s pos tagger is an averaged perceptron and spacy uses a neural model the argument about context still holds though

43223664,ngrams with nonsymmetrical padding in nltk,python nlp nltk ngram,padding ensures that each symbol of the actual string occurs at all positions of the ngram so for grams there will be three padded ngrams of the last symbol e x t x t and t etc as your code shows you the website you link to adds one space on the left then pads properly on the right thats why the counts are different this gives the same number of ngrams for all lengths this is the corresponding python code why it was done this way only the author of the blog really knows but one consequence of padding out on the right but not the left is that as the blog points out a given string of length k will produce a fixed number of ngrams k for any ngram size n the initial space doesnt contribute to this but serves as a word boundary sign ngrams that start with a space are wordinitial

42101027,keep trailing punctuation in python nltkwordtokenize,python nlp nltk tokenize,it is a quirk of spelling that if a sentence ends with an abbreviated word we only write one period not two the nltks tokenizer doesnt remove it it splits it off because sentence structure a sentence must end with a period or other suitable punctuation is more important to nlp tools than consistent representation of abbreviations the tokenizer is smart enough to recognize most abbreviations so it doesnt separate the period in lp midsentence your solution with results in inconsistent sentence structure since you now have no sentencefinal punctuation a better solution would be to add the missing period only after abbreviations heres one way to do this ugly but as reliable as the tokenizers own abbreviation recognizer ps the solution you have accepted will completely change the tokenization leaving all punctuation attached to the adjacent word along with other undesirable effects like introducing empty tokens this is most likely not what you want

41276039,why nltk uses regular expressions for word tokenization but training for sentence tokenization,python nlp nltk,im not sure if you can say that sentence splitting is harder than word tokenisation but tokenisation depends on sentence splitting so errors in sentence splitting will propagate to tokenisation therefore youd want to have reliable sentence splitting so that you dont have to make up for it in tokenisation and it turns out that once you have good sentence splitting tokenisation works pretty well with regexes why is that one of the major ambiguities in tokenisation in latin script languages at least is the period it can be a full stop thus a token of its own an abbreviation mark belonging to that abbreviation token or something special like part of a url a decimal fraction once the sentence splitter has figured out the first case full stops the tokeniser can concentrate on the rest and identifying stuff like urls is exactly what you would use a regex for isnt it the sentence splitters main job on the other hand is to find abbreviations with a period you can create a list for that by hand or you can train it on a big text collection the good thing is its unsupervised training you just feed in the plain text and the splitter collects abbreviations the intuition is if a token almost always appears with a period then its probably an abbreviation
40957598,how can i retrieve the antonym synset of a target synset in nltks wordnet,python nlp nltk wordnet lemmatization,for some reason wordnet indexes antonymy relations at the lemma level instead of the synset see so the question is whether synsets and lemmas have manytomany or onetoone relations in the case of ambiguous words one word many meaning we have a onetomany relation between stringtosynset eg in the case of one meaningconcept multiple representation we have a onetomany relation between synsettostring where string refers to lemma names note up till now we are comparing the relationships between string and synsets not lemmas and synsets the cute thing is that lemma and string has a onetoone relationship the name property of a lemma object returns a unicode string not a list from the code points and and it seems like the lemma has a onetoone relation with synset from docstring at lemma attributes accessible via methods with the same name name the canonical name of this lemma synset the synset that this lemma belongs to syntacticmarker for adjectives the wordnet string identifying the syntactic position relative modified noun see for all other parts of speech this attribute is none count the frequency of this lemma in wordnet so we can do this and somehow know that each lemma object is only going to return us synset assuming that you are trying to do some sentiment analysis and you need the antonyms of every adjective in wordnet you can easily do this to accept the synsets of the antonyms
40812157,nltk fcfg grammar using python,python pythonx nlp nltk,in this line short answer semv pp is concatenating two strings first one from sem feature of nodes in v and second coming from pp longer answer the grammar gives you a parser which you can form a tree structure for a given text on each node of this tree you can manipulate features while you building them up with the parser this way you can form a semantic representation for the tree between these representations you can see first order logic and lambda functions and a useful representation is sql query which you are using here depending on the parser you may need different manipulations of features on lambda function the parser needs function compositions and logical operations and here on sqlqueries the parser mainly works with string concatenation update in this syntax each line of rule has two sides left hand side and right hand side lhs rhs the parser is expected to find a tree which parentnodes are one of nonterminal lhs nodes and follow one of these rules as they only take children from rhs then for the semantic part the semantic representation of parentnode is the result of composing representations of its direct children in this syntax on right hand side you can use question mark like var to handle agreements between siblings on right hand side then you can pass the value to left hand side by assigning them to another feature or manipulate them if your parser supports such thing like function application or logical manipulation the semantic representation of parentnode basically is result of manupulation of semantic representation of its children in fcfg you pass semantic representations like a feature from right hand side to the left hand side

37573533,is textconcordance in nltk available for pyspark as distributed method,python apachespark nlp nltk pyspark,there are two issues here first this maps over the individual tokens in words that is youre converting each word into a oneword text what you want instead of map is mappartitions this creates one text for each partition for example the first gives us the length of each word in characters while the second gives us the length of each partition in words but the second problem is that the concordance method displays the concordance lines but always returns none so theres no easy way for spark to get the results depending on what you want to do with the concordance it should be easy enough to adapt textconcordance to do what you want take a look at the source code on github if your goal is just to be able to interactively produce concordances for really large texts though id recommend using something specially designed for that task for example ims corpus workbench can perform complex searches over s of millions of words in seconds

37299003,nltk sentence boundary error,python pythonx nlp nltk,it looks like you need to loop over enumeratewords instead of enumeratewords as youve written it you are calling punctfeatureswords i on the last word in the list when the index of the last word in the list i is passed to punctfeatures you then try to access wordsi as tokensi since there are only i items in words you get an indexerror
36836481,nltk remove tags from parsed chunks,python nlp nltk,its even more inefficient than you realize youre producing a parse tree converting it to a string wrapping it as if its multiple trees it isnt then parsing the wrapped string back into a tree as soon as you have the parse tree result stop and just remove the pos tags an nltk tree is a kind of list so just iterate over the branches of your tree and remove the pos tag from the leaf tuples to get your desired format you also need to add a level of wrapping around words that are not nps

35377376,getting nltk tree leaf values as a string,python tree nlp nltk stanfordnlp,in short use the treeleaves function to access the strings of the subtrees within the parsed sentence ie theres no proper way to access the true vp strings as they were in the input because stanford parser tokenized the text before the parsing process and the offset of the strings were not kept by the nltk api in long this long answer is such that other nltk users can get to the point of accessing the tree object using nltk api to the stanford parser it might not be as trivial as shown in the question first setup the environmental variables for nltk to access the stanford tools see tldr apply the hack for stanford parser compiled on this hack will become obsolete in the bleeding edge version with now to the phrase extraction first we parse the sentence then we traverse the tree and check for vp as you have done with aftewards we simply use the subtree leaves to get the vps so to get the vp strings alternatively i personally like to use a chunker instead of a full blown parser for extracting phrases using the nltkcli tool the outputs of the vp tags are separated by ie output represents calibrated to benchmark performed and the vpnp chunks output are also separated by and the vp and np are separated by t ie output represents vp np calibrated the low defaults portfolio to benchmark ratings
35345761,python resplit vs nltk wordtokenize and senttokenize,python regex nlp nltk tokenize,the default nltkwordtokenize is using the treebank tokenizer that emulates the tokenizer from the penn treebank tokenizer do note that strsplit doesnt achieve tokens in the linguistics sense eg it is usually used to separate strings with specified delimiter eg in a tabseparated file you can use strsplitt or when you are trying to split a string by the newline n when your textfile has one sentence per line and lets do some benchmarking in python out if we try a another tokenizers in bleeding edge nltk from out note the source of the text file is from if we look at the native perl implementation the python vs perl time for the toktoktokenizer is comparable but do that in the python implementation the regexes are precompiled while in perl it isnt but then the proof is still in the pudding note when timing the toktokpl we had to pipe the output into a file so the timing here includes the time the machine takes to output to file whereas in the nltktokenizetoktoktokenizer timing its doesnt include time to output into a file with regards to senttokenize its a little different and comparing speed benchmark without considering accuracy is a little quirky consider this if a regex splits a textfileparagraph up in sentence then the speed is almost instantaneous ie work done but that would be a horrible sentence tokenizer if sentences in a file is already separated by n then that is simply a case of comparing how strsplitn vs resplitn and nltk would have nothing to do with the sentence tokenization p for information on how senttokenize works in nltk see training data format for nltk punkt use of punktsentencetokenizer in nltk so to effectively compare senttokenize vs other regex based methods not strsplitn one would have to evaluate also the accuracy and have a dataset with humanly evaluated sentence in a tokenized format consider this task given the text in the third category he included those brothers the majority who saw nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance such were willarski and even the grand master of the principal lodge finally to the fourth category also a great many brothers belonged particularly those who had lately joined these according to pierres observations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire for anything but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young brothers who were influential through their connections or rank and of whom there were very many in the lodgepierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing freemasonry at any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals he did not think of doubting freemasonry itself but suspected that russian masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles and so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the orderwhat is to be done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthrow everything repel force by forceno we are very far from that every violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs no violence but what is there in running across it like that said ilagins groom once she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take it ilagin was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop and his excitement we want to get this so simply doing strsplitn will give you nothing even without considering the order of the sentences you will yield positive result

34603922,difference between pythons collectionscounter and nltkprobabilityfreqdist,python nlp nltk,nltkprobabilityfreqdist is a subclass of collectionscounter from the docs a frequency distribution for the outcomes of an experiment a frequency distribution records the number of times each outcome of an experiment has occurred for example a frequency distribution could be used to record the frequency of each word type in a document formally a frequency distribution can be defined as a function mapping from each sample to the number of times that sample occurred as an outcome the inheritance is explicitly shown from the code and essentially theres no difference in terms of how a counter and freqdist is initialized see so speedwise creating a counter and freqdist should be the same the difference in speed should be insignificant but its good to note that the overheads could be the compilation of the class in when defining it in an interpreter the cost of ducktyping init the major difference is the various functions that freqdist provides for statistical probabilistic natural language processing nlp eg finding hapaxes the full list of functions that freqdist extends counter are as followed when it comes to using freqdistmostcommon its actually using the parent function from counter so the speed of retrieving the sorted mostcommon list is the same for both types personally when i just want to retrieve counts i use collectionscounter but when i need to do some statistical manipulation i either use nltkfreqdist or i would dump the counter into a pandasdataframe see transform a counter object into a pandas dataframe

34242030,using nltks universalt tagset with nonenglish corpora,python pythonx nlp nltk postagger,thats an interesting question the nltk implements mapping to the universal tagset only for a fixed collection of corpora with the help of the fixed maps you found in nltkdatataggersuniversaltagset except for a few special cases which include treating the brown corpus as if it was named enbrown the rule is to look for a mapping file that has the same name as the tagset used for your corpus in your case the tagset is set to unknown which is why you see that message now are you sure the mapping for spanish ie the map escastlbmap actually matches the tagset for your corpus i certainly wouldnt just assume it does since any project can create their own tagset and rules for use if this is the same tagset your corpus uses your problem has an easy solution when you initialize your corpus reader eg cessesp add the option tagsetescastlb to the constructor if necessary eg for corpora already loaded by the nltk with tagsetunknown you can override the tagset after initialization like this this tells the corpus reader what tagset is used in the corpus after that specifying tagsetuniversal should cause the selected mapping to be applied if this tagset is not actually suited to your corpus your first job is to study the documentation of the tagset for your corpus and create an appropriate mapping to the universal tagset as youve probably seen the format is pretty trivial you can then put your mapping in operation by dropping it in nltkdatataggersuniversaltagset adding your own resources to the nltkdata area is decidedly a hack but if you get this far i recommend you contribute your tagset map to the nltk which will resolve the hack after the fact edit so per the comments its the right tagset but only the letter pos tags are in the mapping dictionary the rest of the tag presumably describes the features of inflected words heres a quick way to extend the mapping dictionary on the fly so that you can see the universal tags this discards the agreement information if youd rather decorate the universal tags with it just set mapdicttag to mapdicttagtag id save this dictionary to a file as described above so that you dont have to recompute the mapping every time you load your corpus

33266956,nltk package to estimate the unigram perplexity,python nlp nltk ngram languagemodel,perplexity is the inverse probability of the test set normalized by the number of words in the case of unigrams now you say you have already constructed the unigram model meaning for each word you have the relevant probability then you only need to apply the formula i assume you have a big dictionary unigramword that would provide the probability of each word in the corpus you also need to have a test set if your unigram model is not in the form of a dictionary tell me what data structure you have used so i could adapt it to my solution accordingly update as you asked for a complete working example heres a very simple one suppose this is our corpus heres how we construct the unigram model first our model here is smoothed for words outside the scope of its knowledge it assigns a low probability of i already told you how to compute perplexity now we can test this on two different test sets for which you get the following result note that when dealing with perplexity we try to reduce it a language model that has less perplexity with regards to a certain test set is more desirable than one with a bigger perplexity in the first test set the word monty was included in the unigram model so the respective number for perplexity was also smaller
33183618,nltk data out of date python,python download nlp nltk wordnet,in short dont use the gui add all packages within the python interpreter in long it might be because of the recent addition of open multilingual wordnet and something is not working right with the nltk download gui interface and the indices solution simply use the nltkdownload gui and download the two packages without selecting all may not work but worth the try solution install the package individually through the python interpreter solution let the nltkdownloadall check through all packages in its index and download them if theyre not available note if any files was corrupted possibly due to broken internet connection simply find the directory where nltk data is stored and then proceed with solution to find where nltkdata is stored nltkdatapath stores the possible locations since the point of the data download is to use them to know that youre not missing the components you need and if thats wordnet and omw you can try this dont worry so much as in what is shown on the gui once nltkdownloadall is completed without errors it means you have all the corpora and models that nltk supports but as a good practice please raise an issue in so that the developers can check if the problem can be replicated show some more printscreen of the error before and after the proposed solutions too

32981188,penn tree bank tagset for nltk,nlp nltk postagger,the last sentence in your question indicates that youre aware of the universal tagset it only has about pos tags because they need to be broad enough for other tagsets to be mapped to them the penn treebank tagset has a manytomany relationship to brown so no reliable automatic mapping is possible what you can do is use one of the corpora that are already tagged with the penn treebank tagset the nltks sample of the treebank corpus is only th the size of brown words but it might be enough for your purposes alternately you can simplify the brown corpus yourself if you only keep the first part of compound tags like vbntlhl or ppshvd the complex tags are reduced to if thats still too many inspect the definitions and manually collapse it further eg by merging nn and nns singular and plural

32333996,python nltk wup similarity score not unity for exact same word,python nlp nltk similarity,this is an interesting problem tldr sorry theres no short answer to this problem too long want to read looking at the code for wupsimilarity the problem comes from not the similarity calculations but the way nltk traverse the wordnet hierarchies to get the lowestcommonhypernym see normally the lowest common hypernyms between a synset and itself would have to be itself but in the case of orange it gives fruit too well have to take a look at the code for the lowestcommonhypernym from the docstring of get a list of lowest synsets that both synsets have as a hypernym when usemindepth false this means that the synset which appears as a hypernym of both self and other with the lowest maximum depth is returned or if there are multiple such synsets at the same depth they are all returned however if usemindepth true then the synsets which hashave the lowest minimum depth and appears in both paths isare returned so lets try the lowestcommonhypernym with usemindepthfalse seems like that resolves the ambiguity of the tied path but the wupsimilarity api doesnt have the usemindepth parameter note the difference is that when usemindepthfalse the lowestcommonhypernym checks for maximum depth while traversing synsets but when usemindepthtrue it checks for minimum depth see so if we trace the lowestcommonhypernym code this weird phenomena with wupsimilarity is actually highlighted in the code comments and when the first subsumer in the list is selected at naturally in the case of orange synset fruit is selected first sense its first of the list that have tied lowest common hypernyms to conclude the default parameter is sort of a feature not a bug to maintain the reproducibility as with nltk vx so the solution might be to either manually change the nltk source to force usemindepthfalse edited to resolve the problem possibly you can do an adhoc check for same synset

32078901,genia tagger file not found error in anacondanltk,python package nlp nltk anaconda,tldr im not sure whether the packages for genia tagger works out of the box from conda so i think a native pythonpip fix is simpler firstly theres no support for genia tagger in nltk at least not yet so it isnt a problem with the nltk installationmodules the problem might lie in some outdated imports that the original geniatagger c code uses so to resolve the problem you have to add include to the original code but thankfully saffsd has already done so and put it nicely in his github repo then comes installing the python wrapper you can either install from the official pypi with pip install or use some other github repo to install eg that appears first from google search lastly the geniatagger initialization in python is rather weird because it doesnt really take the path to the directory of the tagger but the tagger itself and assumes that the model files are in the same directory as the tagger see and possibly it expects some use of in the first level of directory path so you would have to initialize the tagger as such geniataggergeniataggergeniatagger beyond the installation issues if you use the python wrapper for the geniatagger theres only one function in the geniatagger object ie parse when you use parse it will output a list of tuples for each sentence and the input is one sentence string the items in each tuple are token surface word lemma see stemmers vs lemmatizers pos tag looks like penn treebank tagset see what are all possible pos tags of nltk noun chunk see output results in conll format postagging stanford pos tagger named entity chunk

29110950,python concordance command in nltk,python nlp nltk,concordance is a special nltk function so you cant just call it on any python object like your list more specifically concordance is a method in the text class of nltk basically if you want to use the concordance you have to instantiate a text object first and then call it on that object text a text is typically initialized from a given document or corpus eg concordance concordanceword width lines print a concordance for word with the specified context window word matching is not casesensitive so i imagine something like this would work not tested

28522106,fcfg error in nltk python grammar issue,python nlp nltk contextfreegrammar,the error comes from how nltk implements types lambda calculus it expects lowercase letters to have type and uppercase letters to have type that is to say that lowercase letters cannot represent predicates the following parses xxysomey as an aside one represents the concept of some in some x are y with a conjunction as follows in words some x are y is logically equivalent to there are some items have both x and y quality
28475620,wordnet lemmatizer in nltk is not working for adverbs,python nlp nltk wordnet,try see getting adjective from an adverb in nltk or other nlp library for more information the question is why do you have to go through the lemmas to get the pertainyms its because wordnet sees it as a lexical association between word categories see pertainyms are relational adjectives and do not follow the structure just described pertainyms do not have antonyms the synset for a pertainym most often contains only one word or collocation and a lexical pointer to the noun that the adjective is pertaining to participial adjectives have lexical pointers to the verbs that they are derived from then again if we look at the java interface getting a synsets pertainym is as easy as adjectivesynsetgetpertainyms so i guess it depends on who writes the interface what sort of perspective they take towards adjectiveadverb relationship for me i think pertainyms would have been directly related to the synset rather than the lemma

27975767,what are and nltk,python nlp nltk semantics firstorderlogic,see nltksemlogicexpression is this is the base abstract object for all logical expressions there are many types of logical expressions implemented in nltk see line the applicationexpression is this class is used to represent two related types of logical expressions the first is a predicate expression such as pxy a predicate expression is comprised of a functionvariableexpression or constantexpression as the predicate and a list of expressions as the arguments the second is a an application of one expression to another such as xdogxfido the reason predicate expressions are treated as application expressions is that the variable expression predicate of the expression may be replaced with another expression such as a lambdaexpression which would mean that the predicate should be thought of as being applied to the arguments the logical expression reader will always curry arguments in a application expression so x yseexyjohnmary will be represented internally as x yseexyjohnmary this simplifies the internals since there will always be exactly one argument in an application the str method will usually print the curried forms of application expressions the one exception is when the the application expression is really a predicate expression ie underlying function is an abstractvariableexpression this means that the example from above will be returned as x yseexyjohnmary im not exactly an expert in formal logics but your code above is trying to declare a logical function variable x for a crash course see and a nltk crash course to lambda expressions see
27869416,nltk can i add terminal to grammar that is already generated,python nlp nltk contextfreegrammar,in short yes it is possible but you will get through a heck of pain its easier to rewrite your cfg using the atiscfg as a base then read the new cfg textfile its easier than to reassign each new terminal to the correct nonterminal to map them in long see the following first lets look at what a cfg grammar in nltk is and what it contains for more details see seems like the terminals and nonterminals are of production type see ie a grammar production each production maps a single symbol on the lefthand side to a sequence of symbols on the righthand side in the case of contextfree productions the lefthand side must be a nonterminal and the righthand side is a sequence of terminals and nonterminals terminals can be any immutable hashable object that is not a nonterminal typically terminals are strings representing words such as dog or under so lets take a look at how the grammar stores the productions so now it seems like we could just create the nltkgrammarproduction objects and append them to the grammarproductions lets try with the original grammar the original grammar doesnt have the terminal singapore before we try to add singapore into the grammar lets see how detroit is stored in the grammar so now we can try to recreate the same production object for singapore but its still not working but cause giving the terminals itself dont really help in relating it to the rest of the cfg and hence singapore is still not parseable from the following we know that singapore is like detroit and detroit leads to this lefthandside lhs nounnp detroit so what we will need to do is to either add another production for singapore that leads to nounnp nonterminals or append our singapore lhs to the nounnp nonterminals right handside now lets add the new production for nounnp singapore and now we should expect our parser to work out but it looks like the grammar is still not recognizing the new terminals and nonterminals weve added so lets try a hack and output our new grammar into string and create a newer grammar from the output string out

19899245,nlp how to find name and numbers from given text using python nltk,python python nlp nltk,this is an entity recognition problem i would probably start by making separate parsers for each entity you want to recognize and working up from there for ex make the patent identifier which from your example looks like you will have to recognize ignoring case patent no xxxxxxx or usxxxxxxx and probably more formats you will need to create regexs for these or train a classifier to recognize them harder but possibly more accurate i personally recommend starting with a regex parser for each entity and then just keep testing until youre satisfied
19145332,nltk counting frequency of bigram,python nlp nltk,the problem is with the way you are trying to use applyfreqfilter we are discussing about word collocations as you know a word collocation is about dependency between words the bigramcollocationfinder class inherits from a class named abstractcollocationfinder and the function applyfreqfilter belongs to this class applyfreqfilter is not supposed to totally delete some word collocations but to provide a filtered list of collocations if some other functions try to access the list now why is that imagine that if filtering collocations was simply deleting them then there were many probability measures such as likelihood ratio or the pmi itself that compute probability of a word relative to other words in a corpus which would not function properly after deleting words from random positions in the given corpus by deleting some collocations from the given list of words many potential functionalities and computations would be disabled also computing all of these measures before the deletion would bring a massive computation overhead which the user might not need after all now the question is how to correctly use the applyfreqfilter function there are a few ways in the following i will show the problem and its solution lets define a sample corpus and split it to a list of words similar to what you have done for the purpose of experimenting i set the window size to notice that for the sake of comparison i only use the filter on finder now if i write the output is i will get the same result if i write the same for finder so at first glance the filter doesnt work however see how it has worked the trick is to use scorengrams if i use scorengrams on finder it would be and the output is now notice what happens when i compute the same for finder which was filtered to a frequency of and the output notice that all the collocations that had a frequency of less than dont exist in this list and its exactly the result you were looking for so the filter has worked also the documentation gives a minimal hint about this issue i hope this has answered your question otherwise please let me know disclaimer if you are primarily dealing with tweets a window size of is way too big if you noticed in my sample corpus the size of my sample tweets were too small that applying a window size of can cause finding collocations that are irrelevant

16274623,can nltk be used in a postgres python stored procedure,postgresql nlp nltk,you can use pretty much any python library in a plpython stored procedure or trigger see the plpython documentation concepts the crucial point to understand is that plpython is cpython in postgresql up to and including anyway it uses exactly the same interpreter that the normal standalone python does it just loads it as a library into the postgresql backed with a few limitations outlined below if it works with cpython it works with plpython if you have multiple python interpreters installed on your system versions distributions bit vs bit etc you might need to make sure youre installing extensions and libraries into the right one when running distutils scripts etc but thats about it since you can load any library available to the system python theres no reason to think nltk would be a problem unless you know it requires things like threading that arent really recommended in a postgresql backend sure enough i tried it and it just worked see below one possible concern is that the startup overhead of something like nltk might be quite big you probably want to preload plpython it in the postmaster and import the module in your setup code so its ready when backends start understand that the postmaster is the parent process that all the other backends fork from so if the postmaster preloads something its available to the backends with greatly reduced overheads test performance either way security because you can load arbitrary c libraries via plpython and because the python interpreter has no real security model plpythonu is an untrusted language scripts have full and unrestricted access to the system as the postgres user and can fairly simply bypass access controls in postgresql for obvious security reasons this means that plpython functions and triggers may only be created by the superuser though its quite reasonable to grant normal users the ability to run carefully written functions that were installed by the superuser the upside is that you can do pretty much anything you can do in normal python keeping in mind that the python interpreters lifetime is that of the database connection session threading isnt recommended but most other things are fine plpython functions must be written with careful input sanitation must set searchpath when invoking the spi to run queries etc this is discussed more in the manual limitations longrunning or potentially problematic things like dns lookups http connections to remote systems smtp mail delivery etc should generally be done from a helper script using listen and notify rather than an inbackend job in order to preserve postgresqls performance and avoid hampering vacuum with lots of long transactions you can do these things in the backend it just isnt a great idea you should avoid creating threads within the postgresql backend dont attempt to load any python library thatll load the libpq c library this could cause all sorts of exciting problems with the backend when talking to postgresql from plpython use the spi routines not a regular client library dont do very longrunning things in the backend youll cause vacuum problems dont load anything that might load a different version of an already loaded native c library say a different libcrypto libssl etc dont write directly to files in the postgresql data directory ever plpython functions run as the postgres system user on the os so they dont have access to things like the users home directory or files on the client side of the connection test result so as i said try it so long as the python interpreter postgresql is using for plpython has nltks dependencies installed it will work fine note plpython is cpython but id love to see a pypy based alternative that can run untrusted code using pypys sandbox features

15916143,checking english grammar with nltk,nlp grammar nltk contextfreegrammar,grammar checking is an active area of nlp research so there isnt a answer maybe not even an answer at this time the simplest approach or at least a reasonable baseline would be an ngram language model normalizing lm probabilities for utterance length and setting a heuristic threshold for grammatical or ungrammatical you could use googles ngram corpus or train your own on indomain data you might be able to do that with nltk you definitely could with lingpipe the sri language modeling toolkit or opengrm that said an ngram model wont perform all that well if it meets your needs great but if you want to do better youll have to train a machinelearning classifier a grammaticality classifier would generally use features from syntactic andor semantic processing eg postags dependency and constituency parses etc you might look at some of the work from joel tetrault and the team he worked with at ets or jennifer foster and her team at dublin sorry there isnt an easy and straightforward answer
15768680,nltk regular expressions and cfgs,python regex nlp nltk contextfreegrammar,from the documentation of regexpparser the patterns of a clause are executed in order an earlier pattern may introduce a chunk boundary that prevents a later pattern from executing sometimes an individual pattern will match on multiple overlapping extents of the input as with regular expression substitution more generally the chunker will identify the first match possible then continue looking for matches after this one has ended the clauses of a grammar are also executed in order a cascaded chunk parser is one having more than one clause the maximum depth of a parse tree created by this chunk parser is the same as the number of clauses in the grammar that is each clausepattern is executed once thus youll run into trouble as soon as you need the output of a later clause to be matched by an earlier one a practical example is the way something that could be a complete sentence on its own can be used as a clause in a larger sentence the cat purred he heard that the cat purred she saw that he heard that the cat purred as we can read from the documentation above when you construct a regexpparser youre setting an arbitrary limit for the depth of this sort of sentence there is no recursion limit for contextfree grammars the documentation mentions that you can use looping to mitigate this somewhat if you run through a suitable grammar two or three or four times you can get a deeper parse you can add external logic to loop your grammar many times or until nothing more can be parsed however as the documentation also notes the basic approach of this parser is still greedy it proceeds like this for a fixed or variable number of steps do as much chunking as you can in one step use the output of the last step as the input of the next step and repeat this is nave because if an early step makes a mistake this will ruin the whole parse think of a garden path sentence the horse raced past the barn fell and a similar string but an entirely different sentence the horse raced past the barn it will likely be hard to construct a regexpparser that will parse both of these sentences because the approach relies on the initial chunking being correct correct initial chunking for one will probably be incorrect initial chunking for the other yet you cant know which sentence youre in until youre at a late level in the parsing logic for instance if the barn fell is chunked together early on the parse will fail you can add external logic to backtrack when you end up with a poor parse to see if you can find a better one however i think youll find that at that point more of the important parts of the parsing algorithm are in your external logic instead of in regexpparser

8841569,find subject in incomplete sentence with nltk,python nlp nltk,nlp techniques are relatively ill equipped to deal with this kind of text phrased differently it is quite possible to build a solution which includes nlp processes to implement the desired classifier but the added complexity doesnt necessarily pays off in term of speed of development nor classifier precision improvements if one really insists on using nlp techniques postagging and its ability to identify nouns is the most obvious idea but chunking and access to wordnet or other lexical sources are other plausible uses of nltk instead an adhoc solution based on simple regular expressions and a few heuristics such as these suggested by nobugs is probably an appropriate approach to the problem certainly such solutions bear two main risks overfitting to the portion of the text reviewedconsidered in building the rules possible messinesscomplexity of the solution if too many rules and subrules are introduced running some plain statical analysis on the complete or very big sample of the texts to be considered should help guide the selection of a few heuristics and also avoid the overfitting concerns im quite sure that a relatively small number of rules associated with a custom dictionary should be sufficient to produce a classifier with appropriate precision as well as speedresources performance a few ideas count all the words and possibly all the bigrams and trigrams in a sizable portion of the corpus a hand this info can drive the design of the classifier by allowing to allocate the most effort and the most rigid rules to the most common patterns manually introduce a short dictionary which associates the most popular words with their pos function mostly a binary matter here ie nouns vs modifiers and other nonnouns their synonym root if applicable their class if applicable if the pattern holds for most of the input text consider using the last word before the end of text or before the first comma as the main key to class selection if the pattern doesnt hold just give more weight to the first and to the last word consider a first pass where the text is rewritten with the most common bigrams replaced by a single word even an artificial code word which would be in the dictionary consider also replacing the most common typos or synonyms with their corresponding synonym root adding regularity in the input helps improve precision and also help making a few rules a few entries in the dictionary have a big return on precision for words not found in dictionary assume that words which are mixed with numbers andor preceded by numbers are modifiers not nouns assume that the consider a twotiers classification whereby inputs which cannot be plausibly assigned a class are put in the manual pile to prompt additional review which results in additional of rules andor dictionary entries after a few iterations the classifier should require less and less improvements and tweaks look for nonobvious features for example some corpora are made from a mix of sources but some of the sources may include particular regularities which help identify the source andor be applicable as classification hints for example some sources may only contains say uppercase text or text typically longer than characters or truncated words at the end etc im afraid this answer falls short of providing pythonnltk snippets as a primer towards a solution but frankly such simple nltkbased approaches are likely to be disappointing at best also we should have a much bigger sample set of the input text to guide the selection of plausible approaches include ones that are based on nltk or nlp techniques at large

6585728,which classifier to choose in nltk,nlp classification nltk,naive bayes is the simplest and easy to understand classifier and for that reason its nice to use decision trees with a beam search to find the best classification are not significantly harder to understand and are usually a bit better maxent and svm tend be more complex and svm requires some tuning to get right most important is the choice of features the amountquality of data you provide with your problem i would focus first on ensuring you have a good trainingtesting dataset and also choose good features since you are asking this question you havent had much experience with machine learning for nlp so id say start of easy with naive bayes as it doesnt use complex features you can just tokenize and count word occurrences edit the question how do you find the subject of a sentence and my answer are also worth looking at

5574301,reading and writing pos tagged sentences from text files using nltk and python,python nlp textfiles nltk,the nltk has a standard file format for tagged text it looks like this callnnp meprp ishmaelnnp you should use this format since it allows you to read your files with the nltks taggedcorpusreader and other similar classes and get the full range of corpus reader functions confusingly there is no highlevel function in the nltk for writing a tagged corpus in this format but thats probably because its pretty trivial the nltk does provide nltktagtuplestr but it only handles one word its simpler to just type wordtag if you save your tagged text in one or more files filentxt in this format you can read it back with nltkcorpusreadertaggedcorpusreader like this note that the sents method gives you the untagged text albeit a bit oddly spaced theres no need to include both tagged and untagged versions in the file as in your example the taggedcorpusreader doesnt support file headers for the title etc but if you really need that you can derive your own class that reads the file metadata and then handles the rest like taggedcorpusreader

62766888,is there a simple way to know the gender of a person proper noun in nltk or spacy,pythonx nltk spacy,no there is no way for spacy or nltk to tell the gender of a person entity there are two ways you can solve this use spacy phrasematcher and feed in male and female name this would be equivalent of a dictionary lookup train a custom spacy model and teach it what male and female names are it would still be ideal to start with use it to detect male and female names in your examples texts use the indices of the start and end of the match to detect to label your example texts and then use that to train a generalized model

79229713,define equality predicate lambdacalculus nltk,python nltk grammar lambdacalculus,by its syntactic definition are is applied first to the object np linguists and then to the subject np all logicians to yield a sentence so we need something that abstracts over two nps the quantified np all linguists in subject position will reduce to we then want this quantified subject np to be applied to the object np so that linguists can fill in for q so what are needs to do after taking an object np p and a quantified subject np r is to apply the latter to the former thus we get we can see that this matches the given category as taking an np and another np to yield a sentence with this we get the reduction behavior as desired old answer preserved as an alternative and arguably better bot not allowed by the assignment approach the problem with your grammar starts at an earlier point you should not need two different definitions for each predicate logician linguists to make them work in different syntactic positions of the sentence they are nps functions which abstract over individuals and return true or false the category n does not match this behavior it is meant for names or pronouns referring directly to a single individual so these definitions should go and only the ones with np remain the quantifiers are as you correctly lambdadefined them functions which successively combine with two predicates nps on their right to form a sentence s so their category must be snpnp since non takes an np to become another np its category must be npnp now what we want for the behavior of are is ie that when applied with a predicate it reduces to just that predicate itself so are is the identify function on predicates pp syntactically it combines with an np to yield another np so its category is npnp now we get the reduction behavior as desired

73577656,python nltk train data set,python nltk mwe,it sounds like you are talking about training a named entity recognition ner model for movie names to train an ner model in the traditional way youll need more than a list of movie names youll need a tagged corpus that might look something like the following based on the dataset format here but going on for a very long time say minimum words to give enough examples of movie names in running text each word is following by the partofspeech pos tag and then the ner tag bmov indicates that game is the start of a movie name and imov indicates that of and thrones are inside a movie name by the way isnt game of thrones a tv series as opposed to a movie im just reusing your example anyway how would you create this dataset annotating by hand it is a laborious process but this is how stateoftheart ner systems are trained because whether or not something should be detected as a movie name depending on the context in which it appears for example there is a disney movie called aliens but the same word aliens is a movie title in the second sentence below but not the first aliens are hypothetical beings from other planets i went to see aliens last week tools like docanno exist to aid the annotation process the dataset to be annotated should be selected depending on the final use case for example if you want to be able to find movie names in news articles use a corpus of news articles if you want to be able to find movie names in emails use emails if you want to be able to find movie names in any type of text use a corpus with a wide range of different types of texts this is a good place to get started if you decide to stick with training and ner model using nltk although some of the answers here suggest other libraries you might want to use such as spacy alternatively if the whole tagging process sounds like too much work and you just want to use your list of movie names look at fuzzy string matching in this case i dont think nltk is the library to use as im not aware of any fuzzy string matching features in nltk you might instead use fuzzysearch as per the answer here

60291151,why do i get typeerror unhashable type when using nltk lemmatizer on sentence,python nltk lemmatization,lets walk through the code and see how to get your desired output first the imports you have and then you were using since youre already using from nltk import postag the postag is already in the global namespace just do idiomatically the imports should be cleaned up a little to look like this next actually keeping the list of tokenized words and then the list of pos tags and then the list of lemmas separately sounds logical but since the function finally only returns the function you should be able to chain up the postagwordtokenize function and iterate through it so that you can retrieve the pos tag and tokens ie out now we know that theres a mismatch between the outputs of postag and the pos that the wordnetlemmatizer is expecting from there is a function call pennmorphy that looks like this an example and if we use these converted tags as inputs to the wordnetlemmatizer and reusing your ifelse conditions out hey what did you do there your code works but mine doesnt okay now that we know how to get the desired output lets recap first we clean up imports then we clean up the preprocessing without keeping intermediate variables then we functionalized the conversion of pos tags from penn morphy lastly we applied the same ifelse conditions and run the lemmatizer but how is it that my code doesnt work okay lets work through your code to see why youre getting the error first lets check every output that you get within the findtag function printing the type of the output and the output out at sentence wordtokenizesentence you have already overwritten your original variable to the function usually thats a sign of error later on now lets look at the next line out now we see that the sentence istrip for i in sentence is actually meaningless given the example sentence q but is it true that all tokens output by wordtokenize would have no trailingheading spaces which istrip is trying to do a yes it seems like so then nltk first performs the regex operations on strings then call the strsplit function which would have removed headingtrailing spaces between tokens see lets continue out q wait a minute where is the poslabel only a single string q and what is pos tag p a lets look closer whats happening in nltkpostagsentencelower usually when you have to do such nested index retrieval its error prone we need to ask whats we know that sentence now after sentence wordtokenizesentence has became a list of strings and postagsentence would return a list of tuples of strings where the first item in the tuple is the token and the second the pos tag ie out now if we know thing postagwordtokenizei love running angrily outputs the above lets work with that to see what is accessing so thing outputs the tuple of token pos for the first token and thing outputs the pos for the first token achso the looks for the first character of the pos of the first token so the question is that the desired behavior if so why are you only looking at the pos of the first word regardless of what im looking at your explanation still that doesnt tell me why the typeerror unhashable type list occurs stop distracting me and tell me how to resolve the typeerror okay we move on now that we know thing postagwordtokenizei love running angrily and thinglower p given your ifelse conditions we find that p value would have gone to the else ie printlemlemmatizesentence but wait a minute remember what has sentence became after youve modified it with so what happens if we just ignore all the rest of the code and focus on this out ah ha thats where the error occurs its because wordnetlemmatizer is expecting a single string input and youre putting a list of strings example usage q why didnt you just get to the point a then you would miss out on how to debug your code and make it better

49499770,nltk word tokenizer treats ending single quote as a separate word,python nltk,seems like its a not a bug but the expected output from nltkwordtokenize this is consistent with the treebank word tokenizer from robert mcintyre tokenizersed as prateek pointed out you can try other tokenizers that might suit your needs the more interesting question is why does the starting single quote stick to a the following character couldnt we hack the treebankwordtokenizer like what was done at out yes the modification would work for the string in the op but itll start to break all the clitics eg note that the original nltkwordtokenize keeps the starting single quotes to the clitics and outputs this instead there are strategies to handle the ending quotes but not the starting quotes after a clitics at but the main reason for this problem is because the word tokenizer doesnt have a sense of balancing the quotations mark if we look at the mosestokenizer there are a lot more mechanisms to handle quotes interestingly stanford corenlp doesnt do that in terminal python looks like theres some sort of regex hack put in to recognizecorrect the english clitics if we do some reverse engineering its possible to add a regex to patch wordtokenize eg so we can do something like out
49484820,text categorization test nltk python,python nltk textmining naivebayes,just saving the model will not help you should also save your vectormodel like tfidfvectorizer or countvectorizer what ever you have used for fitting the train data you can save those the same way using pickle also save all those models you used for preprocessing the train data like normalizationscaling models etc for the test data repeat the same steps by loading the pickle models that you saved and transform the test data in train data format that you used for model building and then you will be able to classify
49482417,how to solve a notimplementederror from nltkclassify classifieri,python nltk,as noted in the comments theres some bad spaghetti like code in the classiferi api that has classify calling classifymany when overriden it might not be a bad thing when considering that the classifieri is strongly tied with the naivebayesclassifier object but for the particular use in the op the spaghetti code there isnt welcomed tldr take a look at in long from the traceback the error is starts from nltkclassifyutilaccuracy calling the classifiericlassify the classifiericlassify is generally used to classify one document and the input is a dictionary of featureset with its binary values the classifiericlassifymany is supposed to classify a multiple documents and the input is a list of dictionary of featureset with its binary values so the quick hack is to overwrite how the accuracy function so that the votedclassifier wont be dependent on the classifieri definition of classify vs classifymany that would also mean that we dont inherit from classifieri imho if you dont need other functions other than classify theres no need to inherit the baggage that classifieri might come with now if we call the new myaccuracy with the new votedclassifier object out note theres certain randomness when it comes to shuffling the document and then holding out a set to test for the classifier accuracy my suggestion is to do the following instead of simple randomshuffledocuments repeat the experiments with various random seed for each random seed do a fold cross validation

48049087,nltkbased text processing with pandas,python string pandas dataframe nltk,your function is slow and is incomplete first with the issues youre not lowercasing your data youre not getting rid of digits and punctuation properly youre not returning a string you should join the list using strjoin and return it furthermore a list comprehension with text processing is a prime way to introduce readability issues not to mention possible redundancies you may call a function multiple times for each if condition it appears in next there are a couple of glaring inefficiencies with your function especially with the stopword removal code your stopwords structure is a list and in checks on lists are slow the first thing to do would be to convert that to a set making the not in check constant time youre using nltkwordtokenize which is unnecessarily slow lastly you shouldnt always rely on apply even if you are working with nltk where theres rarely any vectorised solution available there are almost always other ways to do the exact same thing oftentimes even a python loop is faster but this isnt set in stone first create your enhanced stopwords as a set the next fix is to get rid of the list comprehension and convert this into a multiline function this makes things so much easier to work with each line of your function should be dedicated to solving a particular task example getting rid of digitspunctuation or getting rid of stopwords or lowercasing as an example this would then be applyied to your column as an alternative heres an approach that doesnt rely on apply this should be work well for small sentences load your data into a series now comes the heavy lifting lowercase with strlower remove noise using strreplace split words into separate cells using strsplit apply stopword removal using pddataframeisin pddataframewhere finally join the dataframe using agg to use this on multiple columns place this code in a function preprocess and call apply youll still need an apply call but with a small number of columns it shouldnt scale too badly if you dislike apply then heres a loopy variant for you lets see the difference between our nonloopy version and the original first a sanity check now come the timings this is surprising because apply is seldom faster than a nonloopy solution but this makes sense in this case because weve optimised preprocess quite a bit and string operations in pandas are seldom vectorised they usually are but the performance gain isnt as much as youd expect lets see if we can do better bypassing the apply using npvectorize which is identical to apply but happens to be a bit faster because of the reduced overhead around the hidden loop

46096363,nltk reconstruct sentence from tokens,nltk,the nltk provides no such function whitespace is thrown away during tokenization so there is no way to get back exactly what you started with the whitespace might have included newlines and multiple spaces and theres no way to get these back the best you can do is to join the sentence into a string that looks like a normal sentence a simple jointokens will put a space before and after all punctuation which looks odd so you need to get rid of spaces before most punctuation except for a select few like and that should have the space after them removed even then its sometimes guesswork since the apostrophe is sometimes used between words sometimes before and sometimes after nuthin doin yall my recommendation is to hold on to the original strings from which you tokenized the sentence and go back to those you dont show where your sentences come from so theres nothing more to say really edit april in the meantime the nltk provides the following method for turning a list of tokens into a normally punctuated sentence note that you still cant count on getting exactly what you started with

45531514,nltk freqdist counting two words as one,python nltk,one way to accomplish this is by preprocessing your text before you pass it to freqdist this could be done before or after you call wordtokenize assuming thats the only other step in your pipeline otherwise it depends on what the other steps are doing you also have to decide if you want to distinguish between occurrences of heart rate and heartrate or treat them both as the same word if you want to distinguish them and again if it wont mess up later steps you could call it something like heartrate this keeps it as one word but distinct from heartrate ill use this as an example sentence to do this before tokenization you could do a simple replace this results in if you wanted to treat them the same youd just change it to textreplaceheart rate heartrate this would result in if you want to process after tokenization it is a little more complicated since you now have a list of tokens to loop through heres an example when this finds a heart token it checks if the next one is rate and if so merges the two again you can change it from heartrate to heartrate if you wish this function would be used like giving the same results as the first

45425946,tokenize in nltktweettokenizer returning integers by splitting,python nltk tokenize,tldr it seems to be a bugfeature of the tweettokenizer which were unsure what motivates this read on to find out where the bugfeature occurs in long looking at the tokenize function in tweettokenizer before the actual tokenizing the tokenizer does some preprocessing first it remove entities from text by converting them to their corresponding unicode character through the replacehtmlentities function optionally it removes username handles using the removehandles function optionally it normalize the word length through the reducelengthening function then shortens the problematic sequences of characters using the hangre regex lastly the actual tokenization takes place through the wordre regex after the wordre regex it optionally preserve the case of emoticons before lowercasing the tokenized output in code by default the handle stripping and length reduction doesnt kick in unless specified by user lets go through the steps and regexes checked replacehtmlentities isnt the culprit by default removehandles and reducelengthening is skipped but for sanity sake lets see checked too neither of the optional functions are behaving badly klar the hangre is cleared of its name too achso thats where the splits appear now lets look deeper into the wordre its a tuple of regexes the first is a massive url pattern regex from lets go through them one by one ah ha it seems like the nd regex from regexps is causing the problem if we look at the second regex from regexp tries to parse numbers as phonenumbers the pattern tries to recognize optionally the first digits will be matched as international code the next digits as the area code optionally followed by a dash then more digits which is the telecom exchange code another optional dash lastly digit base phone number see for a detailed explanation thats why its trying to split contiguous digits up into digits block but note the quirks since the phone number regex is hard coded it is possible to catch real phone numbers in the ddd or d patterns but if the dashes are in other order it wont work can we fix it see
45353866,nltk interannotator agreement using krippendorff alpha,python nltk metrics,answer provided by klaus krippendorff i do not know the nltk implementation of alpha it does not seem to be wrong from what you reproduced to clarify is not based on the interval metric difference the interval metric difference functions is only one of many versions it responds to meaningful algebraic differences absent in nominal categories incidentally when you have binary data all metric differences should produce the same results as just two values are either same or different let me focus on the two numerical examples you gave of coders coding units the coincidence matrix which tabulates the sum of all possible pairs of valued within units sums to n not in your calculations they look like yes as the variance converges to zero so does alpha in your st example there is virtually no variance and the only deviation from uniformity is a disagreement the data cannot possible be relied upon for computing correlations testing statistical hypotheses providing information about phenomena of interest to answer research questions etc if the annotations were without variation whatsoever the reliability data would not be able to assure you whether coders were asleep decided to code everything alike so as to achieve agreement the instrument they used was broken data need variations in the nd example you do have a larger variance whether you calculate alpha with the nominal or the interval metric the reliabilities have to be higher

44522536,german stemming for sentiment analysis in python nltk,python nltk sentimentanalysis stemming snowball,as a computer scientist you are definitely looking in the right direction to tackle this linguistic issue stemming is usually quite a bit more simplistic and used for information retrieval tasks in an attempt to decrease the lexicon size but usually not sufficient for more sophisticated linguistic analysis lemmatisation partly overlaps with the use case for stemming but includes rewriting for example verb inflections all to the same root form lemma and also differentiating work as a noun and work as a verb although this depends a bit on the implementation and quality of the lemmatiser for this it usually needs a bit more information like postags syntax trees hence takes considerably longer rendering it less suitable for ir tasks typically dealing with larger amounts of data in addition to germanet didnt know it was aborted but never really tried it because it is free but you have to sign an agreement to get access to it there is spacy which you could have a look at very easy to install and use see install instructions on the website then download the german stuff using then as you can see unfortunately it doesnt do a very good job on your specific example suchen and im not sure what the number represents ie must be the lemma id but not sure what other information can be obtained from this but maybe you can give it a go and see if it helps you

43489724,train corpus for ner with nltk ieer or conll corpus,python nltk namedentityrecognition,the nltk provides everything you need read the nltk books chapter on learning to classify text it gives you a worked example of classification then study sections and from chapter which show you how to work with iob text and write a chunking classifier although the example application is not named entity recognition the code examples should need almost no changes to work although of course youll need a custom feature function to get decent performance you can also use the nltks tagger or another tagger to add pos tags to your corpus or you could take your chances and try to train a classifier on data without partofspeech tags just the iob named entity categories my guess is that pos tagging will improve performance and youre actually much better off if the same pos tagger is used on the training data as for evaluation and eventually production use

41468975,sentiment classification with nltk naive baysian classifier,python nltk,looking at the nltk book page it seems the data that is given to the naivebayesclassifier is of the type listtupledictstr whereas the data you are passing to the classifier is of the type listdict if you represent the data in a similar manner you will get different results basically it is a list of feature dict label there are multiple errors in your code python does not use a semicolon as a line ending the true boolean does not seem to serve a purpose on line trainfeatlist and testfeatlist should be lists each value in your feature items list should betupledictstr assign labels to features in the list in take naivebayesclassifier and any use of classifier out of the negative features loop if you fix the previous errors the classifier will work but unless i know what you are trying to achieve it is confusing and does not predict well the main line you need to pay attention to is when you assign something to your variable value for example should be something like then afterwards you would call append on your lists to add each value instead of update you can look at an example of your updated code in a buggy working state at but i would suggest thinking about the following how is the data supposed to be represented for the naivebayesclassifier class what features are you trying to capture what labels are associated with those features
41428534,is there any disadvantage of downloading all corpora in nltk,python nltk,the simple answer is no nltk uses a class called lazycorpusloader for the corpora which are not loaded until needed therefore even if you import a corpus it is not loaded in memory right away for example with the brown corpus memory usage as for memory usage the corpora wont be loaded until read we can view this by using the resource module here is an example with the brown corpus as you can see there is no change in memory usage it will only increase after you load the corpus data into memory in this example by calling taggedsents space usage nltk by default downloads corpora data on unix like systems to nltkdatacorpora upon writing this response i should have the most up to date downloads for all corpora a quick check on size shows i know you mentioned that server space is not a constraint but due to the lazycorpusloader you may be interested in taking it into account

39858195,python nltk download default url will not change,python nltk,the problem comes from your proxy i cant say whats wrong with your proxy configuration but initializing a downloader with a custom download url works as intended there is no need to modify the nltk source in nltkdownloaderpy note that the custom url must resolve to an xml document describing the downloadable resources in the format expected by the nltk the code in your question points to the humanreadable list at which will just result in an error presumably your real code uses a different url and different code around the proxy settings anyway the problem has to be in your proxy or the way you use it the nltks setproxy function just calls a couple of functions from urllibrequest to declare the proxy it never comes near the nltks downloader module so theres no way it could affect the downloaders defaults

39713487,extracting quotationscitations with nltk not regex,python nltk tokenize,well under the hood sexprtokenizer is a regexbased approach as well as can be seen from the source code you linked to what also can be seen from the source is that the authors apparently didnt consider that the opening and closing paren are represented with the same character the depth of the nesting is increased and decreased in the same iteration so the quote seen by the tokenizer is the empty string identifying quotes is not that common in nlp i think people use quotes in many different ways especially if you deal with different languages so its quite hard to get it right in a robust approach for many nlp applications quoting is just ignored id say

39187042,nltk cfg recursion depth error,python nltk,the function generate as its docstring states generates an iterator of all sentences from a cfg clearly it does so by choosing alternative expansions in the order they are listed in the grammar so the first time is sees an np it expands it with the rule np np pp it now has another np to expand which it also expands with the same rule and so on ad infinitum or rather until pythons limits are exceeded to fix the problem with the grammar you provide simply reorder your first two np rules so that the recursive rule is not the first one encountered do it like this and the generator will produce lots of complete sentences for you to examine note that the corrected grammar is still recursive hence infinite if you generate a large enough number of sentences you will eventually reach the same recursion depth limit

39007755,cant find ghostscript in nltk,python environmentvariables ipython nltk ghostscript,in short instead of entities do this or in long the problem lies in you trying to print the output of the nechunk and that will fire ghostscript to get the string and drawing representation of the ne tagged sentence which is an nltktreetree object and that will require ghostscript so you can use the widget to visualize it lets walkthrough this step by step first when you use nechunk you can directly import it at the top level as such and its advisable to use namespaces for your imports ie and when you use nechunk it comes from its unclear what kind of function is the pickle loading but after some inspection we find that theres only one builtin ne chunker that isnt rulebased and since the name of the pickle binary states maxent we can assume that its a statistical chunker so it most probably be comes from the nechunkparser object in this there are ace data api functions too so as the name of the pickle binary now whenever you can the nechunk function its actually calling the nechunkparserparse function that returns a nltktreetree object if we take a look at the nltktreetreeject thats where the ghostscript problems appears when its trying to call the reprpng function but note that its strange that the python interpreter would fire reprpng instead of repr when you use entities at the interpreter see purpose of pythons repr it couldnt be how the native cpython interpreter work when trying to print out the representation of an object so we take a look at ipythoncoreformatters and we see that it allows reprpng to be fired at and we see that when ipython initializes a displayformatter object it tries to activate all formatters note that outside of ipython in the native cpython interpreter it will only call the repr and not the reprpng so now the solution solution when printing out the string output of the nechunk you can use instead of entities that way ipython should explicitly call only the repr instead of call all possible formatters solution if you really need to use the reprpng to visualize the tree object then we will need to figure out how to add the ghostscript binary to the nltk environmental variables in your case it seems like the default nltkinternals are unable to find the binary more specifically were referring to if we go back to we see that its trying to look for the and when nltk tries to initialize its environment variables it is looking at osenviron see note that findbinary calls findbinaryiter which calls findbinaryiter that tries to look for the envvars by fetching osenviron so if we add to the path now this should work in ipython

38309163,nltk tree format is not as docs show it,python nltk,are you sure you just typed entities to get the result you report what you see in the nltk homepage is the unambiguous representation of the tree object its repr form in python terms you get when you dump a variable by just typing its name at the prompt if you print out the tree with printentities which is probably what you actually did it provides the customized more readable form without the tree types and tuple notation so there is no problem and no fix is needed these are two representations of the same object if you have to use print to see the variables content eg you are not at the interactive prompt but you want to match the output you see in the example you can use printreprentities
38233145,nltk most common synonym wordnet for each word,python python pythonx nltk,synonyms are tricky but if you are starting out with a synset from wordnet and you simply want to choose the most common member in the set its pretty straightforward just build your own frequency list from a corpus and look up each member of the synset to pick the maximum the nltk will let you build a frequency table in just a few lines of code heres one based on the brown corpus you can then look up the frequency of a word like this of course youll need to do a little more work i would count words separately for each of the major parts of speech wordnet provides n v a and r resp noun verb adjective and adverb and use these posspecific frequencies after adjusting for the different tagset notations to choose the right substitute
38215686,why freqdist comparisons in nltk are not symmetric ie and behave differently,python nltk,i looked at the comparison methods of the freqdist class and found that they are all based on one method le just to illustrate what that means given this setup these two statements are equivalent now the first thing this method does is check whether the keys of the first freqdist are a subset of the keys of the second one in your example this will always be false which is what this method returns however the operator triggers the gt method to be run which is written to return the negation of le thus it is that you get true as a result to be honest i dont know why comparison methods were added to freqdist at all its parent counter doesnt support comparisons and i suspect thats precisely because its not trivial to say the least to come up with a good solution to this i have a hunch that this code is a relic from the days when freqdist did not inherit from counter and some overzealous oop fan decided that class needed to support comparisons i personally struggle to come up with a situation in which this would be useful if i were you id open an bug report in nltks issue tracker or if you have time just open a pr with this stuff removed

37960667,training iob chunker using nltktagbrilltrainer transformationbased learning,python nltk postagger textchunking,the nltk brill trainer api i wrote it does handle training on sequences of tokens described with multidimensional features as your data is an example of however the practical limits may be severe the number of possible templates in multidimensional learning increases drastically and the current nltk implementation of the brill trainer trades memory for speed similar to ramshaw and marcus exploring the statistical derivation of transformationrule sequences memory consumption may be huge and it is very easy to give the system more data andor templates than it can handle a useful strategy is to rank templates according to how often they produce good rules see printtemplatestatistics in the example below usually you can discard the lowestscoring fraction say with little or no loss in performance and a major decrease in training time another or additional possibility is to use the nltk implementation of brills original algorithm which has very different memoryspeed tradeoffs it does no indexing and so will use much less memory it uses some optimizations and is actually rather quick in finding the very best rules but is generally extremely slow towards end of training when there are many competing lowscoring candidates sometimes you dont need those anyway for some reason this implementation seems to have been omitted from newer nltks but here is the source i just tested it there are other algorithms with other tradeoffs and in particular the fast memoryefficient indexing algorithms of florian and ngai and probabilistic rule sampling of samuel would be a useful additions also as you noticed the documentation is not complete and too much focused on partofspeech tagging and it is not clear how to generalize from it fixing the docs is also on the todo list however the interest for generalized nonpostagging tbl in nltk has been rather limited the totally unsuited api of nltk was untouched for years so dont hold your breath if you get impatient you may wish to check out more dedicated alternatives in particular mutbl and fntbl google them i only have reputation for two links anyway here is a quick sketch for nltk first a hardcoded convention in nltk is that tagged sequences tags meaning any label you would like to assign to your data not necessarily partofspeech are represented as sequences of pairs token tag token tag the tags are strings in many basic applications so are the tokens for instance the tokens may be words and the strings their pos as in as an aside this sequenceoftokentagpairs convention is pervasive in nltk and its documentation but it should arguably be better expressed as named tuples rather than pairs so that instead of saying you could say for instance the first case fails on nonpairs but the second exploits duck typing so that taggedsequence could be any sequence of userdefined instances as long as they have an attribute token now you could well have a richer representation of what a token is at your disposal an existing tagger interface nltktagapifeaturesettaggeri expects each token as a featureset rather than a string which is a dictionary that maps feature names to feature values for each item in the sequence a tagged sequence may then look like there are other possibilities though with less support in the rest of nltk for instance you could have a named tuple for each token or a userdefined class which allows you to add any amount of dynamic calculation to attribute access perhaps using property to offer a consistent interface the brill tagger doesnt need to know what view you currently provide on your tokens however it does require you to provide an initial tagger which can take sequences of tokensinyourrepresentation to sequences of tags you cannot use the existing taggers in nltktagsequential directly since they expect word tag but you may still be able to exploit them the example below uses this strategy in myinitialtagger and the tokenasfeaturesetdictionary view the setup above builds a pos tagger if you instead wish to target another attribute say to build an iob tagger you need a couple of small changes so that the target attribute which you can think of as readwrite is accessed from the tag position in your corpus token tag and any other attributes which you can think of as readonly are accessed from the token position for instance construct your corpus tokentag tokentag for iob tagging change the initial tagger accordingly modify the featureextracting class definitions
37958781,which tokenizer is better to be used with nltk,python nltk tokenize,looking at the source code for senttokenize reveals that this method currently uses the pretrained punkt tokenizer so it is the equivalent to punktsentencetokenizer whether or not you will need to retrain your tokenizer depends on the nature of the text you are working with if it is nothing too exotic like newspaper articles then you will likely find the pretrained tokenizer to be sufficient tokenizing boils down to a categorization task and thus different tokenizers could be compared by using the typical metrics such as precision recall fscore etc on labelled data the punkt tokenizer is based on the work published in the following paper it is fundamentally a heuristic based approach geared to disambiguating sentence boundaries from abbreviations the bane of sentence tokenization calling it a heuristic approach is not meant to be disparaging i have used the builtin sentence tokenizer before and it worked fine for what i was doing of course my task did not really depend on accurate sentence tokenizing or rather i was able to throw enough data at it where it did not really matter here is an example of a question on so where a user found the pretrained tokenizer lacking and needed to train a new one how to tweak the nltk sentence tokenizer the text in question was moby dick and the odd sentence structure was tripping up the tokenizer some examples of where you might need to train your own tokenizer are social media eg twitter or technical literature with lots of strange abbreviations not encountered by the pretrained tokenizer
37862845,subtree extraction nltk tree,python nltk subtree,i cant say i understand your complaint about parent perhaps you meant subtrees but there are easier ways to get your hands on subtrees superficial improvement the subtrees function accepts a filter argument so you dont have to check the returned subtrees in your code a subtree is a reference to a subpart of the original tree if you dont modify it it is still part of the original and you can ascend the tree since you use parented trees in fact note that if you make modifications to the contents of a subtree the original tree will be modified but instead of embedding the tree you found under a new node build a wholly new copy then you you can freely delete or alter branches in the copy and you still have the original tree and subtree to work with although you can use the parent method to climb up the tree i often find it more convenient to work with tree positions a tree position is a tuple of integers which functions as a path down the tree use it like an integer index on a list to find the parent you just need to slice off the last element of the treeposition note that if you use this method you dont need the parent method anymore and hence you might as well use tree not parentedtree the above probably doesnt do precisely what you wanted its kind of hard to see what you are doing exactly but i hope you get the picture

37157822,applying nltkfreqdist after splitting a csv,python csv nltk frequencydistribution,you seem to be missing a couple of steps along the way sir when you iterate over the rows in the file splitting them by your result is actually a sequence of lists what i think you want correct me if im wrong is to stitch these lists into one big one so that you can count frequencies of items in the whole file you can do this with something like the following now that you have all your words in one list you can count their frequencies based on the output data you describe i actually think nltkfreqdist is overkill for this and you should be just fine with collectionscounter note that since freqdist inherits from counter you can easily substitute it in the snippet above in case you still really want to use it if youre using python counteritems returns an iterator not a list so you have to explicitly convert it et viola you have your tokens paired up with their respective counts one final note you may have to call strstrip on your tokens because i dont think splitting by will remove the whitespace between the words and the delimiters but that depends on what your real data looks like and whether you want to take spaces into account or no

36966184,nltk classifier object,python nltk,the classifier needs to be trained on the whole data set the trainingset in your code for you to be able to make correct predictions and tests on the testingset since training more than one classifiers with parts of the dataset will not work or at least it will not be the optimal solution i would suggest the following things try to solve the memory error if you are running on windows and python bit take a look at this try to optimize your code data and maybe use less features or represent them in a more spacememory efficient way if and dont work and want to combine many classifier objects to one but only when it comes to their predictions you could try ensemble methods but i really believe that this is besides the point of what you are trying to do and is not going to fix the issue you are facing in any case heres an example of a maxvote classifier

36794817,nltk naive bayes why are some features none,python nltk naivebayes,i think the full docstring for the naivebayesclassifier class explains if the classifier encounters an input with a feature that has never been seen with any label then rather than assigning a probability of to all labels it will ignore that feature the feature value none is reserved for unseen feature values you generally should not use none as a feature value for one of your own features if your data contain a feature that was never associated with a label the value of that feature will be none suppose you train a classifier with features w x and then classify something with features w x z the value none will be used for feature z because that feature was never seen in training further explanation seeing none does not surprise me because language data are sparse in a corpus of movie reviews there will be words that only appear in or documents for example an actors name or word from the title might only appear in review removing frequent stop and infrequent words from a corpus prior to analysis is common for their topic model of science blei and lafferty write the total vocabulary size in this collection is terms we trim the terms that occurred fewer than times as well as stop words
36727005,python loaded nltk classifier not working,python nltk pickle sentimentanalysis naivebayes,the most likely place a pickled classifier can go wrong is with the feature extraction function this must be used to generate the feature vectors that the classifier works with the naivebayesclassifier expects feature vectors for both training and classification your code looks as if you passed the raw words to the classifier instead but presumably only after unpickling otherwise you wouldnt get different behavior before and after unpickling you should store the feature extraction code in a separate file and import it in both the training and the classifying or testing script i doubt this applies to the op but some nltk classifiers take the feature extraction function as an argument to the constructor when you have separate scripts for training and classifying it can be tricky to ensure that the unpickled classifier successfully finds the same function this is because of the way pickle works pickling only saves data not code to get it to work just put the extraction function in a separate file module that your scripts import if you put in in the main script pickleload will look for it in the wrong place

27243658,nltk sentence tokenizer incorrect,nltk,firstly the senttokenize function uses the punkt tokenizer that was used to tokenize wellformed english sentence so by including the correct capitalization would have resolve your problem now lets dig deeper the punkt tokenizer is an algorithm by kiss and strunk see for the implementation this tokenizer divides a text into a list of sentences by using an unsupervised algorithm to build a model for abbreviation words collocations and words that start sentences it must be trained on a large collection of plaintext in the target language before it can be used so in the case of senttokenize im quite sure its train on a wellformed english corpus hence the fact that capitalization after a fullstop is a strong indication of sentence boundary and fullstop itself might not be since we have things like ie eg and in some cases the corpus might have things like put pasta in pot n fill the pot with water with such sentencedocuments in the training data it is very likely that the algorithm thinks that fullstop following a noncaptalized word is not a sentence boundary so to resolve the problem i suggest the following manually segment of your sentences and the retrain a corpus specific tokenizer convert your corpus into wellformed orthography before using senttokenize see also training data format for nltk punkt

22382196,nltk freqdest objects comparison,python nltk comparisonoperators,the freqdistinitsamples constructor creates a dict where key sample value count frequency of the sample so in your case then in your list comprehension statement its doing the same thing for each of the words in the corpus so it now has two freqdist dictionaries it can compare with your if clause given the operator it is looking for words that have a frequency less thanequal to duh those in the sample letters the important thing to note here is the less than piece this allows it skip letters in words that our sample does not contain so if we change the operator to be explicit it would return an empty list since there are no words in the provided corpus that have a singular occurrence of any of the samples ageqwst take this statement for example no surprises here and we also see that out original sample foo appears in the list as well so if we change our operator to be explicit we get a list of the only word that has the exact same sample distribution as ours one final example we still see our sample bar appears in the list however there are two other words with the same sample distribution as ours so if we we still get our original sample bar plus two other iterations of the sample bra and rab this highlights the fact the order of the sample is irrelevant which is consistent with the behavior of python mapping types i would highly recommend you read through the nltk book yes its long and yes its dry at times but it goes into a lot of the theory and methodology on the different modules so based on the level of intrigue in your question i think you would find it insightful

20649682,nltk document classification,python text classification nltk,words just returns the given files as a list of words and punctuation symbols according to the documentation in that respect you can definitely call nltkcorpuswords on any text file you have as for categories further down in the documentation it says that it returns a list of the categories that are defined for this corpus or for the files if it is given however the source for it is a bit more obscure notice that different corpora have different ways of indicating their categories moviereviews does it through directory names but abc and reuters have explicit categories in a file qc has the categories in the same file as with the text it might take a bit of experimenting with your own data to see if you can replicate this behaviour but a reasonable first step would be to add a directory containing a subset of your data to nltkdatacorpora and to play around with the formats you see in other corpora

20256806,python nltk naive bayes doesnt seem to work,python text classification nltk,note that the feature vector in that example is comprised of the most frequent words in the overall corpus so assuming that the corpus is comprehensive a regular review will probably have quite a few of those words in realworld reviews of the latest jackass movie and dallas buyers club i get and features respectively if you feed it a review containing only wonderfully mulan the resulting feature vector only has features set to true basically youre giving it a pseudoreview with little to no information that it knows about or that it can do anything with for that vector its hard to tell what it will predict the feature vector should be healthily populated with vectors leaning in a positive direction for it to output pos maybe look at the most informative say features look at which ones lean positively and then create a string with only those that might get you closer to pos but not necessarily some feature vectors in the trainset classify as pos anecdotally i found one of them to have features equal to true however in my tests no documents from the neg or pos training set partitions classified to pos so while you may be right that the classifier doesnt seem to be doing a great job at least the pos training examples should classify to pos the example youre giving it is not a great measure of that

17647120,extracting nouns alone from nltk wordnet,python nltk wordnet,to detect if a word is a noun or not try this in order to solve the second part a word may have many meanings you would want to define clearly what your meaning is there are various relations between words such as hypernymy holonymy hyponymy synonym etc also finding a meaning that is closest in meaning to a given word you may need to find the similarity between a word and each of its synsets and pick up the one with the highest value refer to lch similarity and jcn similarity modules within wordnet for more information on this
17631510,nltk with flask import error,python flask nltk importerror,it looks like the activation of your virtualenv is causing the problem did you activate the virtualenv before running sudo pip install u pyyaml nltk if not they were installed globally remember that by default when you create a virtualenv environment it will ignore all packages not installed directly into the environment itself in other words it will ignore the packages you installed globally using aptget install so you have two options install your dependencies into your virtualenv by activating the virtualenv then doing pip install nltk if nltk depends on any development libraries you will need to install those development libraries as well those can be installed using your package manager aptget rebuild your virtualenv this time using the systemsitepackages option this will allow you to use packages installed outside of the virtualenv environment

17458751,python symmetric word matrix using nltk,python nltk textmining,first we tokenize the text iterate through each sentence and iterate through all pairwise combinations of the words in each sentence and store out counts in a nested dict this is essentially like a matrix in that we can index sparsematrixgoodbarbara and get the number and index sparsematrixbadbarbara and get but we actually arent storing counts for any words that never cooccured the is just generated by the defaultdict only when you ask for it this can really save a lot of memory when doing this stuff if we need a dense matrix for some type of linear algebra or other computational reason we can get it like this i would recommend looking at for other ways of dealing with matrix sparsity

17259970,tagging pos in nltk using backoff ngrams,python nltk postagger,spaceghost is correct you need to provide a reference back to an actual ngramtagger object as the backoff argument and not just an int simply using a number as backoff is meaningless when creating a new tagger it has no idea where to look for the previously created tagger with a smaller relative context this is why you get the attributeerror int object has no attribute taggers nltk is looking for an object of a class inheriting from sequentialbackofftagger based on your range im going to guess you actually wanted a trigram tagger with backoff to a bigram tagger with backoff to a unigram tagger you can try something like note no need to import nltk multiple times notice we get none for the pos of words like hi since it doesnt occur in the given corpus browns news category you can set a default tagger if you want by initially setting tagger before the forloop like
17217381,trying to get acronyms from nltk,python nltk,i think youre not calling wordnet the right way now for the spelling errors thing i dont think nltk has builtin features you can either use a library like pyenchant which provides access to some nice c libraries myspell hunspell the main problem imo is that you dont get many different suggestions for the misspelled words check yourself the word submitted by the user and propose alternate spellings this is not a big deal you can start out by studying what does this program or use it directly which provides a good example of how you can build a gram index on a word list to get infos about the lemmas use dir on each object to check its properties and try things out

16678500,python nltk snowball stemmer unicodedecodeerror in terminal but not eclipse pydev,python python pydev nltk snowball,this works in pydev because it configures python itself to work in the encoding of the console which is usually utf you can reproduce the same error in pydev if you go to the run configuration run run configurations then on the common tab say that you want the encoding to be ascii this happens because your word is a string and youre replacing with unicode chars i hope the code below sheds some light for you this is all considering ascii as the default encoding but if you do it all in unicode it works you may need to encode it back afterwards to the encoding you expect if you expect to deal with strings and not unicode so you can make your string unicode before the replace or you can encode the replace chars note however that you must know whats the actual encoding youre working on in any place so although im using cp or utf in the examples it may be different from the encodings you have to use

16489787,nltk naive bayes classifier weird results,python machinelearning nltk,in the movie review classification example in the nltk book notice that the frequency of all the words from all the movies was collected and then only the most common words were chosen to be feature keys i think it is important to note that this is a choice it is not mandatory that the feature keys be chosen this way some other clever choice of features could possibly lead to an even better classifier choosing good features is the art behind the science anyway perhaps try using the same idea in your classifier
16473284,how to find likelihood in nltk,nltk,that is because it is explaining code from nltks source code but not displaying all of it the full code is available on nltks website and is also linked to in the article you referenced these are a field within a method and a method respectively of the naivebayesclassifier class within nltk this class is of course using a naive bayes classifier which is essentially a modification of bayes theorum with a strong naive assumption that each event is independent featureprobdist pfnamefvallabel the probability distribution for feature values given labels it is expressed as a dictionary whose keys are labelfname pairs and whose values are probdistis over feature values ie pfnamefvallabel featureprobdistlabelfnameprobfval if a given labelfname is not a key in featureprobdist then it is assumed that the corresponding pfnamefvallabel is for all values of fval mostinformative features returns a list of the most informative features used by this classifier for the purpose of this function the informativeness of a feature fnamefval is equal to the highest value of pfnamefvallabel for any label divided by the lowest value of pfnamefvallabel for any label check out the source code for the entire class if this is still unclear the articles intent was not to break down how nltk works under the hood in depth but rather just to give a basic concept of how to use it

16407880,extracting specific leaf value from nltk tree structure with python,python tree nltk,although noun phrases can be nested inside other types of phrases i believe most grammars always have nouns in noun phrases so your question can probably be rephrased as how do you find the first and last nouns you can simply get all tuples of words and pos tags and filter like this which in this case is only two so youre done if you had more nouns you would just index the list at and if you were looking for another pos that could be used in different phrases but you only wanted its use inside a particular one or if you had a strange grammar that allowed nouns outside of nps you can do the following you can find subtrees of np by doing continuing to narrow down the subtrees we can use this result to look for nn words so this is a list of lists of all the nns inside each np phrases in this case there happens to only be zero or one noun in each phrase now we just need to go through the nps and get all the leaves of the individual nouns which really means we just want to access the stranger part of treenn stranger
16381218,how do i get the definition for a sense in nltks senseval module,nltk wordsensedisambiguation,i ended up finding out that these correspond to the senses in wordnet which is pretty archaic doesnt seem easily installable on mac os x or ubuntu there are no online versions of wordnet that i could find this site also has some useful information about these three corpora for example it says that the six senses of interest were taken from the longman english dictionary online circa see here it describes the source of hard as wordnet ultimately i ended up manually mapping the definitions to those in wordnet if youre interested heres the dictionary note however that im not an expert on linguistics and theyre not exact
16359680,how to integrate nltk with hadoop hdfs,hadoop hdfs nltk hadoopstreaming,so this wont be completely possible unless nltk can recognize hdfs but most programs like nltk will allow you to pass data directly into the program assuming this is the case you can use what i suggest in this other answer how to run external program within mapper or reducer giving hdfs files as input and storing output files in hdfs you essentially write a small java adapter that opens the input stream of the hdfs file and passes it to the program you want to run if that sounds like too much trouble or just isnt possible for some reason in your case then you can always just use hdfs get to place the file into a local address

16325390,match alphanumeric string in nltk grammar,python parsing nltk,it would be very difficult to do cleanly the base parser classes rely on exact matches or the production rhs to pop content so it would require subclassing and rewriting large parts of the parser class i attempted it a while ago with the feature grammar class and gave up what i did instead is more of a hack but basically i extract the regex matches from the text first and add them to the grammar as productions it will be very slow if you are using a large grammar since it needs to recompute the grammar and parser for every call heres more background where this was discussed on the nltkusers group on google groups
16300067,python nltk exercise chapter,python nltk tagging,wsj is of type nltkcorpusreaderutilconcatenatedcorpusview that behaves like a list this is why you can use functions like index but behind the scenes nltk never reads the whole list into memory it will only read those parts from a file object that it needs it seems that if you iterate over a corpusview object and use index which requires iterating again at the same time the file object will return none this way it works though it is less elegant than a list comprehension

15788084,nltk in production environment,python nltk opennlp,nltk is indeed a good learning platform but is not designed to robustly serve millions of customers you can approach your scalability issues in two different ways the first big data approach adapt your algorithms to mapreduce and run them on mongodbhadoopgoogle mapreduce there are different places to host such solutions amazon google rackspace the second roll your own approach work with common hosting solutions or your own datacenter the big data approach this means rethinking your algorithms requires good mathematical background and sound understanding of the algorithms maybe you would even replace algorithms because execution time is less related to amount of work so in terms of implementing your idea this may be the most difficult and maybe even impossible solution depending on your skills for deployment and future benefits this is by far the easiest solution the roll your own approach you can mean different things with scalability larger training sets more customers more algorithms and applications growing your training sets can mean either retrain or adapt there are different orders of magnitude concerning scalability do you want to scale fold fold fold there are different methods to overcome scalability issues parallellize add exact copies of a server and do load balancing pipelining split processing in different steps that can take place on different servers more expensive hardware faster cpu ram disk buses asics client side processing caching of requests performance tuning of your software implement bottlenecks in cc use better algorithms smarter separation of what happens offline eg with a cron job and what is done per request whatever the type of scalability and whatever the method you use to overcome it do a load test to see what you can handle since you cant afford all your hardware instantly there are different ways to do a load test for a scaled infrastructure rent processors memory disk space per hour just enough to do the load test and bail out that way you dont need to buy equipment more risky do a load test on less and cheaper equipment than will be in production and extrapolate the results maybe you have a theoretical model of how your algorithms scales but beware of side effects the proof of the pudding is in the eating approaching vcs as far as scalability is concerned create a prototype that clearly selfexplains your idea not necessarily scalable prove to yourself that everything will be ok at some point in the future and at what cost minexpectedmax onetimecontinuous cost start with a private beta so that scalability is not an issue right from the start no deadline to go out of beta an estimate is ok but no deadline dont compromise on that good luck

15697623,training and evaluating bigramtrigram distributions with ngrammodel in nltk using witten bell smoothing,python nltk ngram,its apparently been a known issue for almost years the reason for zerodivisionerror is because of the following lines in init whenever the bins argument is not specified it defaults to none so selfz is really just freqdistb freqdistb and reduces down to additionally if you specify bins as any value greater than freqdistb in executing this line of your code you will receive notimplementederror because within the wittenbellprobdist class the discount method is apparently also used in prob and logprob of the ngrammodel class so you wont be able to call them either one way to fix these problems without changing nltk would be to inherit from wittenbellprobdist and override the relevant methods

15366924,python if statement with nltkwordnetsynsets,python nltk wordnet,you cant iterate over a list and remove the current item at the same time here is a toy example which demonstrates the problem you might expect all the items in output to be removed but instead half of them still remain why you cant loop and remove at the same time imagine python using an internal counter to remember the index of the current item as it goes through the forloop when the counter equals the first time through the loop python executes fine there is now one less item in output but then python increments the counter to so the next value of word is output which is the third item in the original list the workaround solution instead either iterate over a copy of output or build a new list in this case i think it is more efficient to build a new list

14201036,do built in pos taggers within nltk have a confidence value for its decisions,python statistics nltk tagging opennlp,nltk taggers do not provide a direct confidence value for each token but the naive bayes tagger allows to pass a cutoff probability the tagger will then return none if the confidence for the pos tag is below i found to be a good tradeoff between precision and recall of course this depends on the needs of your application
14128520,nltk on a production web application,python pyramid nltk,i run textprocessing and its associated nlp apis and it uses about dozen different pickled models which are loaded by a django app gunicorn behind nginx the models are loaded as soon as they are needed and once loaded they stay in memory that means whenever i restart the gunicorn server the first requests that need a model have to wait a few seconds for it load but every subsequent request gets to use the model thats already cached in ram restarts only happen when i deploy new features which usually involves updating the models so id need to reload them anyway so if you dont expect to make code changes very often and dont have strong requirements on consistent request times then you probably dont need a separate daemon other than the initial load time the main limiting factor is memory i currently only have worker process because when all the models are loaded into memory a single process can take up to gb ymmv and for a single mb pickle file your memory requirements will be much lower processing an individual request with an already loaded model is fast enough usually if you are worried about memory then do look into scikitlearn since equivalent models can use significantly less memory than nltk but they are not necessarily faster or more accurate

11822194,how to override the pos tags assigned to a text by nltks postag,python nltk,unfortunately your question boils down to how can i improve my tagging the answer is you need to build a better tagger all nontrivial taggers take context into account so its not just a question of adding context sensitivity its already there its just failing in some cases the nltk tagging model allows you to chain taggers so that each one can take up where the other left off eg the ngram tagger falls back on a regexp tagger for unknown words it works like this traindata here is a list of already tagged sentences in the standard nltk form each sentence is a list of tuples in the form word tag you could use a different training corpus for each tagger if you have reason to youll definitely want to use a consistent tagset for example heres a twosentence long training corpus tagger t the one youll use will build a bigram model if it sees unknown input it will fall back on t which uses a unigram model if that fails too it will defer to t which just tags everything n you could add a specialpurpose retagger to improve the default tagging but of course you must first figure out what to have it do which is of course what you asked in the first place if the nltk tagger keeps making the same kinds of mistakes over and over you can put together a corpus of corrections and train a retagger based on that how much data you need will depend on how consistent the errors are ive never tried this but the brill tagger works by successively applying retagging rules so perhaps its the right tool to use the alternative would be to try building your own domainspecific tagged corpus tag a training set with the nltk tagger correct it manually or semiautomatically then train a tagger on it and try to get better performance on new data than with the default nltk tagger perhaps by chaining the two taggers together

10771538,python nltk freqdist reduce memory usage by writing kv to disk,python key nltk frequencydistribution,by coincidence i had the same problem in the past month i was trying to use nltk and freqdist to create ngram frequency tables from large datasets eg the english wikipedia and gutenberg datasets my gb machine could store a unigram model in memory but not a bigram one my solution was to use berkeleydb which stores a kv database to disk but also stores an inmemory table cache for speed for frequency distributions this is very slow so i also created my own subtables in memory using freqdist and then periodically saved them to berkeleydb typically every or so input files this greatly reduces the berkeleydb writes because it removes a lot of duplicates eg the in a unigram model is only written once instead of many s of times i wrote it up here the problem with using pickle is that you have to store the entire distribution in memory the only way of being purely pythonic is to write your own implementation with its own kv disk database and probably your own inmemory cache using berkeleydb is an awful lot easier and efficient

9777871,using conditional variables with nltks concordance module,python conditionalstatements nltk,i think the problem is that youre trying to supply nltks concordance function with a list of words when it only accepts a string try the following instead then myconcordances should end up as a list where each entry is a concordance for a different word that started with the raw input string you can also consider preallocating the space for myconcordances depending on what specific data type gets returned by the concordance function since you can just check the length of myinputs that might improve speed if its an issue note that this question might be of interest to you too it goes into more detail on concordance

9406093,nltk thinks that imperatives are nouns,python nltk,what youre seeing is a very common problem in traditional statistical natural language processing nlp in short the data you are using the tagger on doesnt look like the data it was trained on nltk doesnt document the details but as far as i know the default tagger is trained on wall street journal articles the brown corpus or some combination of the two these corpora contain very few imperatives so when you give it data with imperatives it doesnt do the right thing a good longterm solution would be to correct the tags for a large corpus of recipes and train on the corrected data that way you solve the problem of mismatch between the training and testing data this is however a huge amount of work ideally a corpus with a lot of imperatives would already exist my research group has looked into this and we have not found a suitable one although we are in the process of producing one a much simpler solution that ive been using on a recent project that required imperatives to be understood correctly is to simply note what the imperatives are that you want and force the tags for those words to be correct so in the example below i made a dictionary saying that combine should be treated as a verb and then used a list comprehension to change the tags the contents of newtaggedwords now has the original tags except changed wherever there was an entry in forcetags this solution does require you to say what the words you want to force to verbs are this is far from ideal but there isnt a better general solution
9288221,nltk certainty measure,python classification nltk probability,i am not sure about the nltk implementation of naive bayes but the naive bayes algorithm outputs probabilities of class membership however they are horribly calibrated if you want good measures of certainty you should use a different classification algorithm logistic regression will do a decent job at producing calibrated estimates

8748870,change from refindallregex text to nltktextfindallregex,python regex nltk,im not sure what youre doing with the first list comprehension youre using findall on each individual word not on the text itself the simplest way to do what you want with the treebank corpus since you already have them divided by sentence is perhaps this is what you wanted to do with the concat function but that just got a list of all words it didnt remove the first of each sentence if you do want to concatenate a list of lists a much better way is the listitertoolschainlists thing i did above eta given that you have to work with a list of tokens the best solution is then not to use regexes but rather

7476180,topic modelling in mallet vs nltk,nltk mallet,its not that one is more complete than the other it is more a question of one having some stuff the other doesnt and vice versa it also a question of intended audience and purpose mallet is a java based machine learning toolkit that aims to provide robust and fast implementations for various natural language processing tasks nltk is built using python and comes with a lot of extra stuff like corpora such as wordnet nltk is aimed more at people learning nlp and as such is used more as a learning platform and perhaps less as an engineering solution in my opinion the main difference between the two is that nltk is better positioned as a learning resource for people interested in machine learning and nlp as it comes with a whole ton of documentation examples corpora etc etc mallet is more aimed at researchers and practitioners that work in the field and already know what they want to do it comes with less documentation although it has good examples and the api is well documented compared to nltks extensive collection of general nlp stuff update good articles describing these would be the mallet docs and examples at the sidebar has links to sequence tagging topic modelling etc and for nltk the nltk book natural language processing with python is a good introduction both to nltk and to nlp update ive recently found the sklearn python library this is aimed at machine learning more generally not directly for nlp but can be used for that as well it comes with a very large selection of modelling tools and most of it seems to rely on numpy so it should be pretty fast ive used it quite a bit and can say that it is very well written and documented and has an active developer community pushing it forward as of may at least update ive now also been using mallet for some time specifically the mallet api and can say that if youre planning on integrating mallet into another project you should be very familiar with java and ready to spend a lot of time debugging an almost completely undocumented code base if all you want to do is to use the mallet command line tools thats fine using the api requires a lot of digging through the mallet code itself and usually fixing some bugs as well be warned mallet comes with minimal documentation with regards to the api

4789318,orange vs nltk for content classification in python,python machinelearning nltk naivebayes orange,well as evidenced by the documentation the naive bayes implementation in each library is easy to use so why not run your data with both and compare the results both orange and nltk are both mature stable libraries years in development for each library that originated in large universities they share some common features primarily machine learning algorithms beyond that they are quite different in scope purpose and implementation orange is domain agnosticnot directed towards a particular academic discipline or commercial domain instead it advertises itself as fullstack data mining and ml platform its focus is on the tools themselves and not the application of those tools in a particular discipline its features include io the data analysis algorithm and a data visualization canvas nltk on the other hand began as and remains an academic project in a computational linguistics department of a large university the task you mentioned document content classification and your algorithm of choice naive bayesian are pretty much right at the core of nltks functionality nltk does indeed have mldata mining algorithms but its only because they have a particular utility in computational linguistics nltk of course includes some ml algorithms but only because they have utility in computational linguistics along with document parsers tokenizers partofspeech analyzers etcall of which comprise nltk perhaps the naive bayes implementation in orange is just as good i would still choose nltks implementation because it is clearly optimized for the particular task you mentioned there are numerous tutorials on nltk and in particular for its naive bayes for use content classification a blog post by jim plus and another in streamhackercom for instance present excellent tutorials for the use of nltks naive bayes the second includes a linebyline discussion of the code required to access this module the authors of both of these posts report good results using nltk in the former in the latter

4176350,using nltk with google app engine,python googleappengine nltk,gae supports pretty much any pure python modules which dont try to access files or sockets or other system level utilities the poster from your link was mostly just trying to minimize the number of modules they included they expressed a trial and error approach to figuring out which nltk modules would be needed for their application a slightly faster approach would be to download the whole nltk package and move in all the py files rather than just one at a time theres no big downside to including modules you wont be using however this process is something of a fact of life with gae any modules that arent directly included in the gae libraries need to be installed manually and they need to be checked for any deviations from the gae sandbox restrictions see this a quick glance at the nltk source code suggests that modules that depend on mallet in particular might be problematic since this is compiled java code

2187510,installing numpy broke nltk os x python,python numpy nltk,it seems to be more of a matter of version incompatibility between scipy and numpy versions than between nltk and numpy while scipy is not required for nltk it is an optional import and will load if available a few hypothesis regarding your situation hyp you formerly were running under numpy along with a compatible version of scipy you recently installed numpy but didnt touch scipy old scipy is broken remedy install newer scipy or uninstall it altogether although you may be usingneeding scipy without knowing it depending on the modules of nltk you use alternate remedy reinstall numpy over hyp less likely you never had scipy and nltk was happy working without it you recently installed numpy over and scipy over nothing for some reason numpy and scipy dont play nice together remedy uninstall scipy
1264847,which word stemmer should i use in nltk,linguistics nltk,it may be a bit different than you are asking but the nodebox lingustics library contains an isemotive function which seems to check words to see if they are recursive hyponyms of certain emotional words from commonsensepy not a stemmer but an interesting approach to check out

71229376,why nltks wordnet lemmatizer does not lemmatize adverbs and adjectives,pythonx lemmatization partofspeech,for the words lovely and absolutely the lemmas are the same heres a few close words you can try in nltk be aware that to get the correct lemma you need the correct partofspeech pos tag and to get the correct pos tag you need to parse a well formed sentence with the word in it so the tagger has the context without this you will often get the wrong pos tag for the word in general nltk is a fairly poor at pos tagging and at lemmatization its an old library that is rule based and it doesnt use more modern techniques i would generally not recommend using nltk spacy is probably the most popular nlp system and it will do pos tagging and lemmatization among other things all in the same step unfortunately spacys lemmatizer uses the same basic design as nltk and while its performance is better its still not the best lemminflect gives the best overall performance but its only a lemmainflection lookup it doesnt include a pos tagger so you still need to get the tag from somewhere lemminflect also acts as a plugin for spacy and using the two together will give you the best performance lemminflects homepage shows how to do this along with some stats on performance compared to nltk and spacy however remember that you wont get the right lemmas without the right pos tag and for spacy or any tagger to get that right the word needs to be in a full sentence
58128757,lemmatization of words using spacy and nltk not giving correct lemma,pythonx lemmatization,lemmatisation is totally dependent on the part of speech tag that you are using while getting the lemma of the particular word the above code is a simple example of how to use the wordnet lemmatizer on words and sentences notice it didnt do a good job because are is not converted to be and hanging is not converted to hang as expected this can be corrected if we provide the correct partofspeech tag pos tag as the second argument to lemmatize sometimes the same word can have a multiple lemmas based on the meaning context for the above example specify the corresponding pos tag
