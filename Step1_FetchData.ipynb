        "I've written a function called `fetch_questions` that's designed to gather questions from Stack Overflow related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Setting up the API:**\n",
        "    * I start by defining the base URL for the Stack Exchange API, which is where I'll be requesting the data from.\n",
        "    * I initialize an empty list called `all_questions` to store all the questions I retrieve.\n",
        "    * I have a list of tags related to NLP, like 'nlp', 'language-model', 'text-classification', and many more. This list is important because I'll use these tags to filter the questions I want.\n",
        "    * I define a dictionary called 'params' that contains all the parameters that will be passed to the stackoverflow api. These parameters include:\n",
        "        * 'page_size': how many questions should be returned per page.\n",
        "        * 'accepted': only return questions that have accepted answers.\n",
        "        * 'order': order the returned questions by their creation date.\n",
        "        * 'sort': sort the returned questions by their creation date.\n",
        "        * 'site': the site to get the questions from, which is stackoverflow.\n",
        "        * 'tagged': the tag to filter the questions by.\n",
        "        * 'key': my api key.\n",
        "        * 'filter': include the body of the question in the returned data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Looping through Pages and Tags:**\n",
        "    * I use a `while` loop to keep fetching questions until I have at least 30,000 questions.\n",
        "    * Inside the loop, I set the `page` and `tagged` parameters in my request.\n",
        "    * I make a request to the Stack Exchange API using the `requests.get()` function.\n",
        "    * I check if the API request was successful (status code 200). If not, I print an error message and stop.\n",
        "    * I print out the page number to monitor the progress of the data fetching.\n",
        "    * I then extract the 'items' from the json response, which are the questions, and append them to the 'all_questions' list.\n",
        "    * I increse the size variable, that keeps track of how many questions have been added.\n",
        "    * I add a small delay using `time.sleep(1)` to avoid overwhelming the API.\n",
        "    * I increment the page number.\n",
        "    * I check if there are more pages for the current tag. If not, I move to the next tag in the list.\n",
        "    * If all tags have been processed, the loop stops.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Returning the Results:**\n",
        "    * Finally, I return the `all_questions` list, which now contains all the fetched questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Creating a DataFrame:**\n",
        "    * Outside the function, I call `fetch_questions()` to get the questions.\n",
        "    * I then convert the list of questions into a Pandas DataFrame for easier data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, I'm using the Stack Exchange API to gather a large dataset of NLP-related questions from Stack Overflow, ensuring I only get questions with accepted answers. I'm iterating through multiple pages and tags to gather enough data. Then, I convert this data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n"
