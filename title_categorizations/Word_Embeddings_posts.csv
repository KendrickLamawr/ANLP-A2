79419884,underfitting pretrained glove lstm model accurcacy unchanged,keras deeplearning nlp lstm sentimentanalysis,based on extra information in the comments im going to say the reason the lstm model hits a wall at an unspecified lower accuracy than the you are trying to reach is because it is not the best type of model for the problem in which case tweaking parameters is likely to be wasted effort im fairly sure encoder transformers eg bert surpassed them in sentiment analysis benchmarks a number of years back but sorry a quick search couldnt find a killer reference to insert here and transformers have only got bigger and better since then extra thought building on top of glove embeddings presents you with the problem that they dont handle multiple meanings of the word so queen might be a female king as in embeddings party trick king male female queen or it might be a pop group or it might be a gay man or it might be a chess piece this is going to put a limit on the accuracy of models built on them whereas transformers dont have that limitation because they look at the whole string to see the words in context it is possible to argue with that of course because bringing in the context is where the lstm comes in but transformers are still scaling strongly with layers whereas lstms tend to choke after two layers

79178041,normalization of token embeddings in bert encoder blocks,nlp normalization bertlanguagemodel attentionmodel,layer normalization is applied to each tokens embedding individually this means each token gets its own normalization based on its specific features this helps to ensure that the model can process each token effectively regardless of the other tokens in the sequence bert differs from the original transformer architecture in the placement of layer normalization in bert its applied before the selfattention mechanism while in the original transformer its applied after this subtle difference can have a significant impact on the models performance see here update please refer to the following paper on layer normalization in the transformer architecture the authors explored both approaches of applying layer normalization before and after attention layernamely preln and postln in bert their results indicate that using layer normalization before the attention layer yields better results for a summarized review of the same paper you can see here overall you might find different bert diagrams in which each used a different approach of using layer normalization

78901998,how does openaiembeddings work is it creating a single vector of size for whole text corpus,deeplearning nlp openaiapi openaiembeddings,everything you described is expected q is the dimensional vector generated for the entire input text a yes q if the dimensional vector represents the entire input text how does the model handle individual words versus longer texts like sentences or paragraphs a first the openai embeddings model doesnt handle a single word any different than a long text for the model its an input the input can be even a single character eg a but it doesnt make sense to calculate an embedding vector out of it since a doesnt semantically mean anything to us humans second what you probably meant with this question is what happens when you do a similarity search with these embeddings in other words what happens when you use them what happens if you use embeddings of words sentences paragraphs or the whole text does it matter yes this is called chunking the decision about how to chunk your text depends on the use case the best thing is probably to simply try and see if you get meaningful results after doing a similarity search then this means that chunking is appropriate even if this means chunking the whole text if you dont get meaningful results after doing a similarity search then this means that chunking isnt appropriate eg instead of chunking by paragraph try chunking by sentences theres an excellent stack overflow blog post about this topic you should read pay attention to the bolded text because this is the best explanation with rag you create text embeddings of the pieces of data that you want to draw from and retrieve that allows you to place a piece of the source text within the semantic space that llms use to create responses when it comes to rag systems youll need to pay special attention to how big the individual pieces of data are how you divide your data up is called chunking and its more complex than embedding whole documents the size of the chunked data is going to make a huge difference in what information comes up in a search when you embed a piece of data the whole thing is converted into a vector include too much in a chunk and the vector loses the ability to be specific to anything it discusses include too little and you lose the context of the data

77748737,how to calculate word and sentence embedding using gpt,python machinelearning nlp huggingfacetransformers transformermodel,here is your modified code to compute sentence and word embeddings some relevant facts as you said word embeddings are the last hidden output if you print the out put you see vectors number of sentences of length maximum number of tokens in the list of sentences and shape model dimension it means that some sentences have embeddings for non existent tokens so we need to mask the output to consider only existent tokens mask consists on multiplying by zero or whatever special value but zero is the more accepted and useful as it nulls values on non existent token places of the word vector the attention mask is crucial for handling variablelength sequences and ensuring that padding tokens do not contribute to the embeddings usually sentence embeddings are computed as the sum mean or max of the masked word embeddings it depends on your use case mean is more suitable to variable length sum is intended to force importance on relevant parts it exist a lot of techniques and it depends on how embeddings perform for your task i would choose a method that maximices the cosine similarity between vectors i consider similar for my task ex if the sum gets more similarity than mean it may be more suitable additionally i suggest you to normalize values by the number of tokens in the sentence so that with that normalization larger sentences tend to have lower vector values it is to embed information on the number of tokens in the sentence it prevents to get high similarity scores between a sentence of tokens with a whole book that its meaningless

76825022,why nnembedding layer is used for positional encoding in bert,pytorch nlp huggingfacetransformers bertlanguagemodel wordembedding,nnembedding is just a table of vectors its input are indices to the table its output are the vectors associated to the indices from the input conceptually it is equivalent to having onehot vectors multiplied by a matrix because the result is just the vector within the matrix selected by the onehot input bert is based on the transformer architecture the transformer architecture needs positional information to be added to the normal tokens for it to distinguish where each token is at the positional information in the original formulation of the transformer architecture can be incorporated in different ways both with equal performance numbers static sinusoidal vectors the positional embeddings are precomputed trained positional embeddings the positional embeddings are learned the authors of the bert article decided to go with trained positional embeddings anyway in both cases the positional encodings are implemented with a normal embedding layer where each vector of the table is associated with a different position in the input sequence update positional embeddings are not essentially different from word embeddings the only difference is how they are trained in word embeddings you obtain the vectors so that they can be used to predict other words that appear close to the vectors word in the training data in positional embeddings each vector of the table is associated with an index representing a token position and you train the embeddings so that the vector associated with a specific position when added to the token embedding at that position is helpful for the task the model is trained on masked lm for bert machine translation for the original transformer therefore the positional embeddings end up with information that depends on the position because the positional embedding vector is selected based on the position of the token it will be used for and which has been trained to be useful for the task later the authors of the transformer article discovered that they could simply devise a static not trained version of the embeddings ie the sinusoidal embeddings which reduced the total size of the model to be stored in this case the information in the precomputed positional vectors together with the learned token embeddings is enough for the model to reach the same level of performance in the machine translation task at least

76472136,how embedding lookup works in wordvec,machinelearning nlp wordvec wordembedding,theres a lot of custom intros to the wordvec algorithm online that in my opinion are quite unhelpful in what they choose to highlight so if youre struggling with a particular one id suggest moving on to some other and if you have to go someplace else like stackoverflow to explain some external writeup try to provide a link to the full original source as context for understanding what that particular author has adopted as their mentalmodel further if your true interest is in understanding actual wordvec implementation studying working source code may be a better path than more abstract writeups for seeing what actually happens although abstractly you can think of a wordvector lookup as being the multiplication of a onehot vector times a countofvocabulary x countofdimensions matrix ive not seen popular implementations like googles original wordvecc release or the python gensim library do exactly that so learning that form can mislead when later using or reviewing the source code of or implementing real code instead implementations tend to use the wordtoken as a key to lookup a rownumber inside some sort of dicthashtable no onehot vector is ever created except abstractly in the sense that a simple int can be thought of as representing the onehot vector with a single one at that int index then they use that rownumber to access the words vector from a matrix thats better considered the input weights that lead to a hiddenlayer rather than any hidden layer itself the hidden layer activations at least in modes like skip gram is then that vector itself that is despite the abstract description in implementations no multiplication occurs an indexlookup occurs then a simple rowaccessbythatindex occurs and then youve got a words vector and yes its the same result asf thered been a onehot multiplication at least in a simple skipgram mode where the input to the network is a single context word to try to map to that diagrams top monochrome half you have a word vocabulary where each word has dimensions the columns of that w w table with based indexes are the individual wordvectors this varies from most implementations i know where individual wordvectors are the rows of the models matrix so per the top monochrome half you get the dimensional wordvector for the st of words by pulling the column thats w w rows column in contrast per the bottom multicolor half you get the dimensional wordvector for the th of words by pulling the row thats cell to cell rows columns the bottom diagram better fits the implementations i know there learned wordvectors both the inprogress vectors grabbed for adjustment during training whats accessed at the end as final wordvectors are more often stored as the rows of an input weights matrix that matrix can be thought of as a mapping from onehot vectors to hiddenlayer activations but really isnt a hidden layer itself and further in a mode like cbow with averaging the actual hidden layer activations are an average of multiple rows values of your diagrams the bottom better represents usual implementations though again usually no actual multiplication by a onehot occurs hope this helps

75545619,how seqseq context vector is generated,deeplearning nlp lstm attentionmodel seqseq,in a sequencetosequence seqseq model the context vector is a representation of the input sequence generated by the encoder and used by the decoder to generate the output sequence the encoder produces a set of hidden states that capture relevant information about the input sequence up to that point in time the context vector is then generated by combining these hidden states in some way in the attention mechanism the context vector is a weighted sum of the hidden states while in a basic seqseq model without attention the context vector is typically the final hidden state produced by the encoder during decoding the context vector is used by the decoder to generate each element of the output sequence the context vector is not the same as the average of the word embeddings in the input sequence and is a learned representation that is specific to the task at hand and model architecture the formula you provided ci ij hj is the standard formula for computing the context vector using the attention mechanism in a basic seqseq model without attention the context vector is typically the final hidden state produced by the encoder this hidden state is then used as the initial hidden state for the decoder which generates the output sequence one step at a time during decoding the context vector is used by the decoder to generate each element of the output sequence at each time step the decoder takes in the previous output element and the current hidden state and produces a new hidden state and output element as an example lets say we have arabic sentence and we want to translate it to english sentence here is what happens we accomplish this task by training arabic as input sequence and arabic as output sequence now the model consists of main components an encoder and a decoder the encoder takes in the english sentence as input and produces a fixedlength context vector that summarizes the input sequence the decoder then takes in the context vector and generates the corresponding english translation one word at a time andrew ng videos on youtube provide perfect explanation i myself learned it from him

74307142,why isnt my gensim fasttext model continuing to train on a new corpus,python nlp gensim fasttext,models generally have a mincount value of at least meaning words with fewer occurrences are ignored discarding the rarest words typically improves model quality as both such rare words have too few usage examples to get a good vector themselves and further by pushing surrounding words outside each others windows and spending training cycles internalweight updates on a vector that still wont be good they make other wordvectors worse with larger training data increasing the mincount even higher makes sense so your problem is likely because a single occurence of that word is insufficient to make it a tracked word using a larger varied corpus with multiple contrasting usage examples at least as many as the modelmincount value would be the best fix separately note that it is always better to train a model with all data at the same time incremental updates will execute but introduce thorny issues of relative balance between older newer sessions to the extent a new session uses only a subset of words and representative wordusages those wordsincluded can be nudged by training out of comparable alignment with words only known in earlier sessions so if trying incremental updates make sure your qualityevaluations are strong enough to detect if the model is actually improving or gettings worse on your real goals

72706958,what is the ideal size of the vector for each word in wordvec,python pythonx machinelearning nlp wordvec,each dimension of a dense vector is typically a bit float so storing tokenvectors of dimensions each will take at least vectors floats bytesfloat mb for the raw vector weights plus some overhead for remembering which token associates with which line lets say you were somehow changing each of your rows into a single summary vector of the same size perhaps by averaging together each of the token vectors into a single vector a simple baseline approach though there are many limitations of that approach other techniques that might be used in that case storing the million vectors will necessarily take about vectors floats bytesfloat mb for the raw vector weights plus some overhead to remember which row associates with which vector that neither of these is anywhere close to gb implies youre making some other choices expanding things significantly json is a poor choice for compactly representing dense floatingpoint numerical data but even that is unlikely to explain the full expansion your description that you saved these vectors for each data point in a json file isnt really clear what vectors are being saved or in what sort of json conventions perhaps youre storing the separate vectors for each row thatd give a raw baseline weightsonly size of rows tokensrow floats bytesfloat gb it is plausible inefficient json is expanding the storedsize by something like x so i guess youre doing something like this but in addition to the inefficiency of json given that the tokens from a vocabulary of k each given enough info to reconstitute any other perrow info thats solely a function of the tokens the k wordvectors theres not really any reason to expand the representations this way for example if the word apple is already in your dataset and appears many thousands of times theres no reason to rewrite the dimensions of apple many thousands of times the word apple alone is enough to callback those dimensions whenever you want them from the muchsmaller mb setofk tokenvectors thats easy to keep in ram so mainly ditch json dont unnecessarily expand each row into dimensions to your specific questions the optimal size will vary based on lots of things including your data other goals the only way to rationally choose is to figure out some way to score the trained vectors on your true end goals some repeatable way of comparing multiple alternate choices of vectorsize then you run it every plausible way pick the best barring that you take a random stab based on some precedent work that seems roughly similar in datagoals and hope that works ok until you have the chance to compare it against other choices the choice of skipgram or cbow wont affect the size of the model at all it might affect end result quality training times a bit but the only way to choose is to try both see which works better for your goals constraints json is an awful choice for storing dense binary data representing numbers as just text involves expansion the json formatting characters add extra overhead repeatedly on every tow thats redundant if every row is the exact same shape of raw data and typical later vector operations in ram usually work best on the same sort of maximallycompact raw inmemory representation that would also be best on disk in fat the best ondisk representation will often be data that exactly matches the format in memory so that data can be memorymapped from disk to ram in a quick direct operation that minimizes formatwrangling even defers accesses until reads needed gensim will efficiently save its models via their buildin save method into one or more often several related files on disk if your gensim wordvec model is in the variable wvmodel you can just save the whole model with wvmodelsaveyourfilename later reload it with wordvecloadyourfilename but if after training you only need the k wordvectors you can just save the wvmodelwv property just the vectors wvmodelwvsaveyourfilename then you can reload them as an instance of keyedvectors keyedvectorsloadyourfilename note in all cases the save may be spread over multiple files which if ever copiedmoved elsewhere should be kept together even though you only ever specify the root file of each set in saveload operations how whether youd want to store any vectorization of your million rows would depend on other things not yet specified including the character of the data and the kinds of classification applied later i doubt that you want to turn your rows into dimensions thatd be counter to some of the usual intended benefits of a wordvecbased analysis where the word apple has much the same significance no matter where it appears in a textual listofwords youd have to say more about your data classification goals to get a better recommendation here if you havent already done a bagofwords style representation of your rows no wordvec where every row is represented by a dimension onehot sparse vector and run a classifier on that id recommend that first as a baseline

72095099,can we deduce the relationship bw a dimension of a word vector with the linguistic characteristic it represents,nlp stanfordnlp wordvec wordembedding,because these word vectors are dense distributional representations it is often difficult impossible to interpret individual neurons and such models often do not localize interpretable features to a single neuron though this is an active area of research for example see analyzing individual neurons in pretrained language models for a discussion of this with respect to pretrained language models a common method for studying how individual dimensions contribute to a particular phenomenon task of interest is to train a linear model ie logistic regression if the task is classification to perform the task from fixed vectors and then analyze the weights of the trained linear model for example if youre interested in part of speech you can train a linear model to map from the word vector to the pos then the weights of the linear model represent a linear combination of the dimensions that are predictive of the feature for example if the weight on the th neuron has large magnitude very positive or very negative you might expect that neuron to be somewhat correlated with the phenomenon of interest note that defining a pos for a particular word is nontrivial since the pos often depends on context for example play can be a noun he saw a play or a verb i will play in the grass

68367520,inconsistencies between bigrams found by tfidfvectorizer and wordvec model,python nlp gensim wordvec tfidfvectorizer,the point of the phrases model in gensim is to pick some bigrams which are calculated to be statisticallysignificant if you then apply that models determinations as a preprocessing step on your corpus certain pairs of unigrams will be outright replaced in your text with the combined bigram as such its possible some unigrams that were there originally will no longer appear even once thus the concepts of bigrams as used by gensims phrases and the tfidfvectorizers ngramrange facility are different phrases is meant for destructive replacements where specific bigrams are inferred to be more interesting than the unigrams tfidfvectorizer will add extra bigrams as additional dimensional features i suppose the right tuning of phrases could cause it to consider every bigram as significant without checking it looks like a supertiny value like might have essentially that effect the phrases class will reject a value of as nonsensical given its usual use but at that point your later transformation via bigramtransformercorpus will combine every possible pair of words before wordvec training for example the sentence would indiscriminately become it seems unlikely that you want that for a number of reasons there might then be no training texts with the cat unigram alone leaving you with no wordvector for that word at all bigrams that are rare or of little grammatical value like theskittish will receive trained wordvectors take up space in the model the kinds of text corpus that are large enough for good wordvec results might have far more bigrams than are manageable a corpus small enought that you can afford to track every bigram may be on the thin side for good wordvec results further to perform that greedycombination of all bigrams the phrases frequencysurvey calculations arent even necessary it can be done automatically with no preparationanalysis so you shouldnt expect every bigram of tfidfvectorizer to be get a wordvector unless you take some extra steps outside the normal behavior of phrases to ensure every such bigram was in the training texts to try to do so wouldnt necessarily need phrases at all and might be unmanageable and involve other tradeoffs for example i could imagine repeating the corpus many times only combining a fraction of the bigrams each time so that each is sometimes surrounded by other unigrams and sometimes by other bigrams to create a synthetic corpus with enough meaningful texts to create all your desired vectors but the logic storage space for that model would be larger complicated and without prominent precedent so itd be a novel experiment

67788151,does adding a list of wordvec embeddings give a meaningful represenation,nlp wordvec embedding languagemodel,averaging is most typical when someone is looking for a supersimple way to turn a bagofwords into a single fixedlength vector you could try a simple sum as well but note that the key difference between the sum and average is that the average divides by the number of input vectors thus they both result in a vector thats pointing in the exact same direction just of different magnitude and the mostoftenused way of comparing such vectors cosinesimilarity is oblivious to magnitudes so for a lot of cosinesimilaritybased ways of later comparing the vectors sumvsaverage will give identical results on the other hand if youre comparing the vectors in other ways like via euclideandistances or feeding them into other classifiers sumvsaverage could make a difference similarly some might try unitlengthnormalizing all vectors before use in any comparisons after such a preuse normalization then euclideandistance smallest to largest cosinesimilarity largesttosmallest will generate identical lists of nearestneighbors averagevssum will result in different ending directions as the unitnormalization will have upped some vectors magnitudes and lowered others changing their relative contributions to the average what should you do theres no universally right answer depending on your dataset goals the ways your downstream steps use the vectors different choices might offer slight advantages in whatever final qualitydesirability evaluation you perform so its common to try a few different permutations along with varying other parameters separately the googlenews vectors were trained on news articles back around their word senses thus may not be optimal for an imagelabeling task if you have enough of your own data or can collect it training your own wordvectors might result in better results both the use of domainspecific data the ability to tune training parameters based on your own evaluations could offer benefits especially when your domain is unique or the tokens arent typical naturallanguage sentences there are other ways to create a single summary vector for a runoftokens not just arithmaticalcomboofwordvectors one thats a small variation on the wordvec algorithm often goes by the name docvec or paragraph vector it may also be worth exploring there are also ways to compare bagsoftokens leveraging wordvectors that dont collapse the bagoftokens to a single fixedlength vector st and while theyre more expensive to calculate sometimes offer better pairwise similaritydistance results than simple cosinesimilarity one such alternate comparison is called word movers distance at some point you may want to try that as well

67518203,how to run fasttext getnearestneighbors faster,python machinelearning nlp gensim fasttext,to do a fully accurate getnearestneighborstype of calculation is inherently fairly expensive requiring a lookup calculation against every word in the set for each new word as it looks like that set of vectors is near or beyond gb in size when just the wordvectors are loaded that means a scan of gb of addressable memory may be the dominant factor in the runtime some things to try that might help ensure that you have plenty of ram if theres any use of swapvirtualmemory that will make things far slower avoid all unnecessary comparisons for example perform your isstrictlysinhalaword check before the expensive step so you can skip the costly step if not interested in the results also you could consider shrinking the full set of wordvectors to eliminate those that you are unlikely to want as responses this might involve throwing out words you know are not of the languageofinterest or all lowerfrequency words if you can throw out half the words as possible nearestneighbors before even trying the getnearestneighbors it will go roughly twice as fast more on these options below try other wordvector libraries to see if they offer any improvement for example the python gensim project can load either plain sets of fullword vectors eg the ccsivec wordsonly file or fasttext models the bin file and offers a mostsimilar function that has some extra options might in some cases offer different performance though the official facebook fasttext getnearestneighbors is probably pretty good use an approximate nearest neighbors library to prebuild an index of the wordvector space that can then offer extrafast nearestneighbor lookups although at some risk of not finding the exact right topn neighbors there are many such libraries see this benchmarking project that compares over of them but adding this step complicates things the tradeoff of that complexity the imperfect result may not be worth the effort timesavings so just remember that its a possibility if your need s large enough nothing else helps with regard to slimming the set of vectors searched the gensim keyedvectorsloadwordvecformat function which can load the vec wordsonly file has an option limit that will only read the specified number of words from the file it looks like the vec file for your dataset has over k words but if you chose to load only k your mostsimilar calculations would go about twice as fast and since such files typically frontload the files with the mostcommon words the loss of the farrarer words may not be a concern siilarly even if you load all the vectors the gensim mostsimilar function has a restrictvocab option that can limit searches to just the st words of that count which could also speed things or helpfully drop obscure words that may be of less interest the vec file may be easier to work with if you wanted to prefilter the words to for example eliminate nonsinhala words note the usual loadwordvecformat text format needs a st line that declares the count of words worddimensionality but you may leave that off then load using the noheadertrue option which instead uses full passes over the file to get the count

64606333,bert embeddings in sparknlp or bert for token classification in huggingface,nlp bertlanguagemodel huggingfacetransformers johnsnowlabssparknlp,to answer your question no hugging face uses different head for different tasks this is almost the same as what the authors of bert did with their model they added taskspecific layer on top of the existing model to finetune for a particular task one thing that must be noted here is that when you add task specific layer a new layer you jointly learn the new layer and update the existing learnt weights of the bert model so basically your bert model is part of gradient updates this is quite different from obtaining the embeddings and then using it as input to neural nets question when you obtain the embeddings and use it for another complex model i am not sure how to quantify in terms of loosing the information because you are still using the information obtained using bert from your data to build another model so we cannot attribute to loosing the information but the performance need not be the best when compared with learning another model on top of bert and along with bert often people would obtain the embeddings and then as input to another the classifier due to resource constraint where it may not be feasible to train or finetune bert

63379360,why word embedding technique works,nlp wordvec wordembedding,this sort of why isnt a great fit for stackoverflow but some thoughts the essence of wordvec similar embedding models may be compression the model is forced to predict neighbors using far less internal state than would be required to remember the entire training set so it has to force similar words together in similar areas of the parameter space and force groups of words into various useful relativerelationships so in your second example of toilet and washroom even though they rarely appear together they do tend to appear around the same neighboring words theyre synonyms in many usages the model tries to predict them both to similar levels when typical words surround them and viceversa when they appear the model should generally predict the same sorts of words nearby to achieve that their vectors must be nudged quite close by the iterative training the only way to get toilet and washroom to predict the same neighbors through the shallow feedforward network is to corral their wordvectors to nearby places and further to the extent they have slightly different shades of meaning with toilet more the device washroom more the room theyll still skew slightly apart from each other towards neighbors that are more objects vs places similarly words that are formally antonyms but easily standin for eachother in similar contexts like hot and cold will be somewhat close to each other at the end of training and their various nearersynonyms will be clustered around them as they tend to be used to describe similar nearby paradigmaticallywarmer or colder words on the other hand your example have a good day probably doesnt have a giant influence on either good or day both words more unique and thus predictivelyuseful senses are more associated with other words the word good alone can appear everywhere so has weak relationships everywhere but still a strong relationship to other synonymsantonyms on an evaluative good or bad likable or unlikable preferred or disliked etc scale all those randomnonpredictive instances tend to cancelout as noise the relationships that have some ability to predict nearby words even slightly eventually find some relativenearby arrangement in the highdimensional space so as to help the model for some training examples note that a wordvec model isnt necessarily an effective way to predict nearby words it might never be good at that task but the attempt to become good at neighboringword prediction with fewer free parameters than would allow a perfectlookup against training data forces the model to reflect underlying semantic or syntactic patterns in the data note also that some research shows that a larger window influences wordvectors to reflect more topicaldomain similarity these words are used about the same things in the broad discourse about x while a tiny window makes the wordvectors reflect a more syntactictypical similarity these words are dropin replacements for each other fitting the same role in a sentence see for example levygoldberg dependencybased word embeddings around its table
63348829,wordsense disambiguation based on sets of words using pretrained embeddings,python nlp pytorch nltk spacy,transfer learning particularly models like allen ais elmo openais opengpt and googles bert allowed researchers to smash multiple benchmarks with minimal taskspecific finetuning and provided the rest of the nlp community with pretrained models that could easily with less data and less compute time be finetuned and implemented to produce state of the art results these representations will help you accuratley retrieve results matching the customers intent and contextual meaning even if theres no keyword or phrase overlap to start off embeddings are simply moderately low dimensional representations of a point in a higher dimensional vector space by translating a word to an embedding it becomes possible to model the semantic importance of a word in a numeric form and thus perform mathematical operations on it when this was first possible by the wordvec model it was an amazing breakthrough from there many more advanced models surfaced which not only captured a static semantic meaning but also a contextualized meaning for instance consider the two sentences below note that the word apple has a different semantic meaning in each sentence now with a contextualized language model the embedding of the word apple would have a different vector representation which makes it even more powerful for nlp tasks contextual embeddings like bert offers an advantage over models like wordvec because while each word has a fixed representation under wordvec regardless of the context within which the word appears bert produces word representations that are dynamically informed by the words around them

63144230,proper way to add new vectors for oov words,python nlp spacy fasttext,i think there is some confusion about the different components ill try to clarify the tokenizer does not produce vectors its just a component that segments texts into tokens in spacy its rulebased and not trainable and doesnt have anything to do with vectors it looks at whitespace and punctuation to determine which are the unique tokens in a sentence an nlp model in spacy can have predefined static word vectors that are accessible on the token level every token with the same lexeme gets the same vector some tokenslexemes may indeed be oov like misspellings if you want to redefineextend all vectors used in a model you can use something like initmodel init vectors in spacy v the tokvec layer is a machine learning component that learns how to produce suitable dynamic vectors for tokens it does this by looking at lexical attributes of the token but may also include the static vectors of the token cf item this component is generally not used by itself but is part of another component such as an ner it will be the first layer of the ner model and it can be trained as part of training the ner to produce vectors that are suitable for your ner task in spacy v you can first train a tokvec component with pretrain and then use this component for a subsequent train command note that all settings need to be the same across both commands for the layers to be compatible to answer your questions isnt the tokvec the part that generates the vectors if you mean the static vectors then no the tokvec component produces new vectors possibly with a different dimension on top of the static vectors but it wont change the static ones what does it mean loading pretrained vectors and then train a component to predict these vectors whats the purpose of doing this the purpose is to get a tokvec component that is already pretrained from external vectors data the external vectors data already embeds some meaning or similarity of the tokens and this is so to say transferred into the tokvec component which learns to produce the same similarities the point is that this new tokvec component can then be used further finetuned in the subsequent train command cf item is there a way to still make use of this for oov words it really depends on what your use is as mentions you can set the vectors yourself or you can implement a user hook which will decide on how to define tokenvector i hope this helps i cant really recommend the best approach for you to follow without understanding why you want the oov vectors what your usecase is happy to discuss further in the comments
63105091,build a multiclass text classifier which takes vectors generated from wordvec as independent variables to predict a class,python machinelearning nlp wordvec textclassification,you can average a bunch of wordvectors for symptoms together to get a single featurevector of the same dimensionality if your wordvectors are d each averaging them together gets a single d summary vector but such averaging is fairly crude and has some risk of diluting the information of each symptom in the averaging as a simplified stylized example imagine a nurse took a patients temperature at pm and found it to be f then again at am and found it to be f a doctor asks hows our patients temperature and the nurse says the average f wow says the doctor its rare for someone to be so onthedot for the normal healthy temperature next patient averaging hid the important information that the patient had both a fever and dangerous hypothermia it sounds like you have a controlledvocabulary of symptoms with just some known capped and notverylarge number of symptom tokens about in such a case turning those into a categorical vector for the presenceabsence of each symptom may work far better than wordvecbased approaches maybe you have different symptoms or different symptoms either way you can turn them into a large vector of s and s representing each possible symptom in order and lots of classifiers will do pretty well with that input if treating the listofsymptoms like a textofwords a simple bag of words representation of the text will essentially be this categorical representation a dimensional onehot vector and unless this is some academic exercise where youve been required to use wordvec its not a good place to start and may not be a part of the best solution to train good wordvectors you need more data than you have to reuse wordvectors from elsewhere they should be wellmatched to your domain wordvectors are most likely to help if youve gots tensofthousands to hundredsofthousands of terms and many contextual examples of each of their uses to plot their subtle variationsofmeaning in a dense shared space only texts of tokens each and only unique tokens is fairly small for wordvec i made similar points in my comments on one of your earlier questions once youve turned each row into a feature vector whether its by averaging symptom wordvectors or probably better creating a bagofwords representation you can and should try many different classifiers to see which works best many are dropin replacements for each other and with the size of your data testing many against each other in a loop may take less than an hour or few if at a total loss where to start anything listed in the classifiers upperleft area of this scikitlearn graphical guide is worth trying if you want to consider an even wider range of possibilities and get a vaguelyintuitive idea of which ones can best discover certain kinds of shapes in the underlying highdimensional data you can look at all those demonstrated in this scikitlearn classifier comparison page with these graphical representations of how well they handle a noisy d classification challenge instead of your d challenge

62244474,text preprocessing for text classification using fasttext,python nlp textclassification fasttext,there is no general answer it very much depends on what task you are trying to solve how big data you have and what language the text is in usually if you have enough data simple tokenization that you described is all you need lemmatization fasttext computes the word embeddings from embeddings of character ngrams it should cover most morphology in most at least european languages given you dont have very small data in that case lemmatization might help removing stopwords it depends on the task if the task is based on grammarsyntax you definitely should not remove the stopwords because they form the grammar if the task depends more on lexical semantics removing stopwords should help if your training data is large enough the model should learn noninformative stopword embeddings that would not influence the classification masking numbers if you are sure that your task does not benefit from knowing the numbers you can mask them out usually the problem is that numbers do not appear frequently in the training data so you dont learn appropriate weightsembeddings for them not so much in fasttext which will compose their embeddings from embeddings of their substrings it will make them probably uninformative at the end not influencing the classification
62211396,how does gensim wordvec word embedding extract training word pair for word sentence,nlp textmining gensim wordvec wordembedding,no wordvec training is possible from a word sentence because theres no neighbor words to use as input to predict a centertarget word essentially that sentence is skipped if that was the only appearance of the word in the corpus and youre seeing a vector for that word its just the starting randominitialization of the word with no further training and you should probably use a higher mincount as keeping such rare words is usually a mistake in wordvec they wont get good vectors and other nearby words vectors will improve if the noise from all such insufficiently modelable rare words is removed if that word sentence actually appeared nextto other real sentences in your corpus it could make sense to combine it with surrounding texts theres nothing magic about actual sentences for this kind wordfromsurroundings modeling the algorithm is just working on neighbors and its common to use multisentence chunks as the texts for training and sometimes even punctuation like sentenceending periods is also retained as words then words from an actuallyseparate sentence but still related by having appeared in the same document will appear in each others contexts

62085134,i want to train more wordvec models and average the resulting embedding matrices,python pandas nlp spacy gensim,theres no reason to average together vectors from multiple training runs it is more likely to destroy any value from the individual runs than provide any benefit no one run creates the right final positions nor do they all approach some idealized positions rather each just creates a setofvectors that is internally comparable to others in that same cotrained set comparisons or combinations with vectors from other noninterleaved training runs are usually going to be nonsense instead aim for one adequate run if vectors move around a lot in repeated runs thats normal but each reconfiguration should be about as useful if used for wordtoword comparisons or analysis of word neighborhoodsdirections or as input to downstream algorithms if they vary wildly in usefulness there are likely other inadequacies in the data or model parameters for example too little data wordvec requires lots to give meaningful results or a model thats too large for the data making it prone to overfitting other observations about your setup just sentencestexts is tiny for wordvec you shouldnt expect the vectors from such a run to have any of the value that the algorithm would usually provide running such a tiny dataset might be helpful for verifying no haltingerrors in the process or familiarize yourself with the stepsapis but the results will tell you nothing mincount is almost always a bad idea in wordvec and similar algorithms words that only appear once or a few times dont have the variety of subtlydifferent uses that are needed to train it into a balanced position against other words so they wind up with weakstrange final positions and the sheer number of such words dilutes the training effectiveness for other morefrequent words the common practice of discarding rare words usually gets better results iter is an extreme choice which is typically only valuable to try to squeeze results out of inadequate data in such a case you might also have to reduce the vectorsize from normal plus dimensions so if you seem to need that getting more data should be a top priority using x more data is far far better than using x more iterations on smaller data but involves the same amount of training time

61876623,meaning of high sparsity matrix from sklearn countvectorizer,scikitlearn nlp countvectorizer,in fact or even of zeros does not mean high sparsity so in your case it is safe enough to just ignore the fact of sparsity and treat your matrix as if it was a dense one really high sparsity is something like of zeros it occurs in problems like recommender systems when there are thousands or even millions of items but each user has interacted only with a few of them another case is when we have very short texts eg tweets or dialogue turns and a very large vocabulary maybe even a multilingual one if the feature matrix has really high sparsity it means that if you want to store your matrix efficiently or make fast calculations with it you may want to use an algorithm that explicitly supports scipys sparse matrices the feature space is probably highdimensional and probably some features are highly correlated with each other therefore you might find dimensionality reduction useful to make your model more tractable and generalize better you can use matrix decomposition techniques eg pca or a neural embedding layer to implement this dimensionality reduction or maybe you can use pretrained word embeddings and somehow aggregate them to represent your document in general the optimal way to represent your document depends on the ultimate problem you are trying to solve for some problems eg text classification with a large training set a highdimensional sparse representation might be optimal for others eg similarity of small texts or text classification with a small labeled training set a lowdimensional dense representation would be better

59193877,can i match words or sentences to a prevectorized corpus of sentences in python for nl processing,python scikitlearn nlp vectorization,my opinion is if you are going to use a wordvec embedding use one pretrained or used generic text to generate it wordvec embedding are usually used to give meaning and context to your text data if you train an embedding using only your data it might be biased and not represent a language and that means it vectors doesnt carry any meaning after having your embedding working you also has to think about what to do with your words because a sentence has or more words embedding works at word level and you want to feed your models with sentence vector not sentences n vectors people usually average or multiply those vectors so for example for the sentence hello there and an embedding of dims hello there avg hello there this is what you want to use for your models so instead of using tfidf to generate your sentence vectors use wordvec like this and you shouldnt have any problem i already work in a text calssification project and we ended usind a selftrained wv embedding an extratrees model with amazing results

58045535,is there a reason to not normalize the document output vectors of docvec for clustering,vector nlp linearalgebra wordvec docvec,im not familiar with any reasoning or research precedent which implies that either unitnormalized or nonnormalized documentvectors are better for clustering so id try both to see which seems to work better for your purposes other thoughts in wordvec my general impression is that largermagnitude wordvectors are associated with words that in the training data have more unambiguous meaning that is they reliably tend to imply the same smaller set of neighboring words meanwhile words with multiple meanings polysemy and usage amongst many other diverse words tend to have lowermagnitude vectors still the common way of comparing such vectors cosinesimilarity is oblivious to magnitudes thats likely because most comparisons just need the best sense of a word without any more subtle indicator of unity of meaning a similar effect might be present in docvec vectors lowermagnitude docvectors could be a hint that the document has more broad wordusagesubjectmatter while highermagnitude docvectors suggest more focused documents id similarly have the hunch that longer documents may tend to have lowermagnitude docvectors because they use a greater diversity of words whereas small documents with a narrow set of wordstopics may have highermagnitude docvectors but i have not specifically observedtested this hunch and any effect here could be heavily influenced by other training choices like the number of training iterations thus its possible that the nonnormalized vectors would be interesting for some clustering goals like separating focused documents from more general documents so again after this longer analysis id suggest trying it both ways to see if one or the other seems to work better for your specific needs

57749696,implementing a tfidf vectorizer from scratch,python machinelearning nlp tfidf,there are a few default parameters that might affect what sklearn is calculating but the particular one here that seems to matter is smoothidf boolean defaulttrue smooth idf weights by adding one to document frequencies as if an extra document was seen containing every term in the collection exactly once prevents zero divisions if you subtract one from each element and raise e to that power you get values that are very close to n for low values of n at any rate there is not a single tfidf implementation the metric you define is simply a heuristic that tries to observe certain properties like a higher idf should correlate with rarity in the corpus so i wouldnt worry too much about achieving an identical implementation sklearn appears to have used logdocumentlength frequency of word which is rather like if there was a document that had every single word in the corpus edit this last paragraph is corroborated by the docstring for tfidfnormalizer
57635101,adding vocabulary and improve word embedding with another model that was built on bigger corpus,machinelearning nlp wordvec fasttext,wordvec and similar models really require a large volume of varied data to create strong vectors but also a models vectors are typically only meaningful alongside other vectors that were trained together in the same session this is both because the process includes some randomness and the vectors only acquire their useful positions via a tugofwar with all other vectors and aspects of the modelintraining so theres no standard location for a word like bar just a good position within a certain model given the training data and model parameters and other words copopulating the model this means mixing vectors from different models is nontrivial there are ways to learn a translation that moves vectors from the space of one model to another but that is itself a lot like a retraining you can preinitialize a model with vectors from elsewhere but as soon as training starts all the words in your training corpus will start drifting into the best alignment for that data and gradually away from their original positions and away from pure comparability with other words that arent being updated in my opinion the best approach is usually to expand your corpus with more appropriate data so that it has enough examples of every word important to you in sufficiently varied contexts many people use large free text dumps like wikipedia articles for wordvector training but be aware that its style of writing dry authoritative reference texts may not be optimal for all domains if your problemarea is business reviews youd probably do best finding other review texts if its fiction stories more fictional writing and so forth you can shuffle these other textsoruces in with your data to expand the vocabulary coverage you can also potentially shuffle in extra repeated examples of your own local data if you want it to effectively have relatively more influence generally merely repeating a small number of nonvaried examples cant help improve wordvectors its the subtle contrasts of different examples that helps but as a way to incrementally boost the influence of some examples when there are plenty of examples overall it can make more sense

57598318,how to use sklearn tfidfvectorizer on new data,python scikitlearn nlp nltk,once you have extracted the vocabulary to generate the sparse vectors during training using tffittransform you need to use tftransform instead of fittransform so the features for the test set should be when you use tffittransform on your test new data it extracts a new vocabulary based on the words in your test data which are likely different than your training data the difference in the vocabulary generates the dimension mismatch error you should also combine both your test data and training data into one master set and then run the fittransform on this master set so that even the words that are only in the test set are captured in your vectorizer the rest of your code can stay the same doing this could improve your accuracy if you have words in the test set that are not in the training set

57489639,universal sentence encoding embedding digits very similar,tensorflow nlp wordembedding,if your sentence embedding are produced using the embeddings of individual words or tokens then a hack could be the following to add dimensions to the word embedding these dimensions would be set to zero for all nonnumeric tokens and for numeric tokens these dimensions would contain values reflecting the magnitude of the numeric value it would get a bit mathematical because cosine similarity uses angles so the extra dimensions added to the embedding would have to reflect the magnitude of the numeric values through larger or smaller angles an easier workaround hack would be to extract the numeric values from the sentences using regular expressions and compute their distance and combine that information with the similarity score in order to obtain a new similarity score
57468725,can we compare word vectors from different models using transfer learning,nlp wordvec glove,simply starting your models with pretrained bectors would eliminate some of the randomness but with each training epoch on your new corpora theres still randomness introduced by negativesampling if using that default mode by frequentword downsampling if using default values of the sample parameter in wordvec and by the interplay of different threads each epoch with your new corpora will be pulling the wordvectors for present words to new better positions for that corpora but leaving original words unmoved the net movements over many epochs could move words arbitrarily far from where they started in response to the wholecorpuseffects on all words so doing so wouldnt necessarily achieve your goal in a reliable or theoreticallydefensible way though it might kindawork at least better than starting from purely random initialization especially if your corpora are small and you do few training epochs thats usually a bad idea you want big varied training data and enough passes for extra passes to make little incremental difference but doing those things wrong could make your results look better in this scenario where you dont want your training to change the original coordinatespace too much i wouldnt rely on such an approach especially if the words you need to compare are a small subset of the total vocabulary a couple things you could consider combine the corpora into one training corpus shuffled together but for those words you need to compare replace them with corporaspecific tokens for example replace sugar with sugarc and sugarc leaving the vast majority of surrounding words to be the same tokens and thus learn a single vector across the whole corpus then the two variant tokens for the same word will learn different vectors based on their differing contexts that still share many of the same tokens using some anchor set of words that you know or confidently conjecture either do mean the same across both contexts or should mean the same train two models but learn a transformation between the two space based on those guide words then when you apply that transformation to other words that werent used to learn the transformation theyll land in contrasting positions in each others spaces maybe achieving the comparison you need this is a technique thats been used for languagetolanguage translation and theres a helper class and example notebook included with the python gensim library there may be other better approaches these are just two quick ideas that might work without much change to existing libraries a project like histwords which used wordvector training to try to track evolving changes in wordmeaning over time might also have ideas for usable techniques

56987977,glove word vectors cosine similarity ally closer to powerful than friend,nlp cosinesimilarity glove,welcome to the wonderful word of learned embeddings and to its pitfalls i am trying to explain this on a higher level but feel free to read up on this topic as there seems to be quite a bit of literature regarding the problem neural networks in general suffer from the problem that the results are not naturally intuitive to humans they often simply find statistically significant similarities in your training data whether they are wanted or not to take your specific example glove and analyze some of the problems let us cite its official documentation glove is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words training is performed on aggregated global wordword cooccurrence statistics from a corpus and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space what this tells us is that the learned representations are in general depending on the context of a specific word imagine if we for example have a training set that consists of a number of news articles it is more likely to encounter articles that talk about alliesally and powerful in the same context think of political news articles compared to articles that mention both ally and friend in a synonymous context unless you actually encounter plenty of examples in which the context for both words is very similar and thus the learned expression is similar it is unlikely that your learned representation is closesimilar the thing about embeddings is that while we can certainly find such counter examples in our data overall they provide a really good numerical interpretation of our vocabulary at least for the most common languages in research english spanish french being probably the most popular ones so the question becomes whether you want to spend the time to manually annotate a whole number of words probably forgetting about associations in their respective context for example apple might be a good example for both the fruit and company but not everyone who hears of toyota also thinks of it as a very common japanese last name this plus the obvious automated processing of word embeddings make them so atractive in the current time im sure i potentially missed a few obvious point and i want to add that the acceptance of embeddings widely ranges between different research areas so please take this with a grain of salt
56953251,how wordvector algorithm find similarity between words,nlp recurrentneuralnetwork wordvec,the wordvectors typically used are actually from a projection layer of the neuralnetwork that projectionlayer essentially converts individual word indexes onehot representations single ints from to v where v is the count of known unique words into input vectors dense embeddings with n nonzero continuous dimensions where n is much smaller than v those input vectors are fed to a shallow neuralnetwork that tries to predict words neighboring words it turns out that when you force those denseembeddings and internal neuralnetwork weights to become better and better at predicting their neighbors wordvectors for related words get closer to each other as a general matter of how related they are and further the simultaneous interleaved attempt to do this for all words and training examples tends to also create meaningful neighborhoods and directions within the final arrangement allowing the interesting meaning arithmetic that lets wordvector operations often solve analogies like man king woman

56584678,questions regarding the input dimensionality of embeddings in keras based on official documentation,python machinelearning keras neuralnetwork nlp,it seems you have misunderstood the embedding layer let me describe it briefly you can look at the embedding layer as a lookup table it takes an integer as input and returns a vector corresponding to the given integer as output so in context of nlp usually those integers correspond to tokens or words in a dictionary which we have created from training data for example this dictionary may look like this so for example the word hi has been assigned the number to it now if we want to represent the sentence hi how are you it would be equivalent to this integer vector is the input of our model and it will be given to the embedding layer as input the embedding layer in return would give the corresponding vectors for example the embedding vectors in the embedding layer at a certain point during training may look like this so for hi how are you it returns the following vectors now you can better understand what those parameters of the embedding layer correspond to the inputdim actually is the number of entries in the lookup table which is equivalent to the number of unique words in our dictionary and the outputdim is the dimension ie length of embedding vectors in the embedding layer in above example the length of each vector is so the outputdim as a side note both of the example codes you have provided would not work thats because the input of your model ie xtrain and xtest does not consist of integers rather they are arrays of float numbers due to using nprandomrandom which is not acceptable when you have an embedding layer as the first layer of your model

55921104,spacy similarity warning evaluating docsimilarity based on empty vectors,pythonx nlp pytorch spacy wordnet,you get that error message when similarword is not a valid spacy document eg this is a minimal reproducible example if you change the to be rabbit it works fine cats are apparently just a fraction more similar to rabbits than dogs are update as you point out unknown words also trigger the warning they will be valid spacy objects but not have any word vector so one fix would be to check similarword is valid including having a valid word vector before calling similarity alternative approach you could suppress the particular warning it is w i believe setting an environmental variable spacywarningignorew before running your script would do it not tested see source code by the way similarity might cause some cpu load so is worth storing in a variable instead of calculating it three times as you currently do some people might argue that is premature optimization but i think it might also make the code more readable
55848136,how to use ml algoritms with feature vector data from bag of words,python machinelearning nlp dataanalysis,you knew already how to prepare data set for training its an example what i make to explain and we got training data set and the model needs to predict one unit in units what you defined so we need a classification machine learning model a classification machine learning model requires softmax as an activation function of the output layer and a crossentropy loss function is required it is very simple deep learning model written by keras apis of tensorflow and it is the model consist of one hidden layer with cells and output layer with cells i set epochs as you need to see loss and acc while it is running to learn actually was not enough and i will start to learn and its a part of prediction newsample is just sample what i made finally i got a result as below it means the possibility of each unit and the highest possibility is microsofttech and it is the result of learning steps you can see that loss is being reduced consistently so i increased the number of epochs
55757851,how to resolve memory overloading by passing an iterator to countvectorizer,scikitlearn nlp,the reason why countvectorizer will consume much more memory is that the countvectorizer needs to store a vocabulary dictionary in memory however the hashingvectorizer has a better memory performance because it does not need to store the vocabulary dictionary the main difference between these two vectorizers is mentioned in the doc of hashingvectorizer this strategy has several advantages it is very low memory scalable to large datasets as there is no need to store a vocabulary dictionary in memory it is fast to pickle and unpickle as it holds no state besides the constructor parameters it can be used in a streaming partial fit or parallel pipeline as there is no state computed during fit there are also a couple of cons vs using a countvectorizer with an inmemory vocabulary there is no way to compute the inverse transform from feature indices to string feature names which can be a problem when trying to introspect which features are most important to a model there can be collisions distinct tokens can be mapped to the same feature index however in practice this is rarely an issue if nfeatures is large enough eg for text classification problems no idf weighting as this would render the transformer stateful and of course the countvectorizer will load one document at a time do the fit and then load the next one in this process the countvectorizer will build its vocabulary dictionary as the memory usage surging to optimize the memory you may need to reduce the size of document dataset or giving a lower maxfeatures parameter may also help however if you want to resolve this memory problem completely try to use the hashingvectorizer instead of the countvectorizer
55700359,whats the different between fasttext skipgram and wordvec skipgram,nlp fasttext,tldr the optimization criterion is the same the difference is how the model gets the word vector using formulas fasttext optimizes the same criterion as the standard skipgram model using the formula from the fasttext paper with all the approximation tricks that make the optimization computationally efficient in the end they get this there is a sum over all words wc and approximate the denominator using some negative samples n the crucial difference is in the function s in the original skipgram model it is a dot product of the two word embeddings however in the fasttext case the function s is redefined word wt is represented as a sum of all ngrams zg the word consist of plus a vector for the word itself you basically want to make no only the word but also all its substrings probable in the given context window

55121521,why no word embeddings glove wordvecetc used in first attention paper,nlp wordembedding machinetranslation attentionmodel,in short the model certainly does use word embeddings they are just not pretrained embeddings like glove or wordvec instead the embeddings are randomly initialised and jointly trained along with the rest of the network in the full description of the network in section a of the original bahdanau et al paper youll see the word embedding matrices e described for both the encoder and decoder how they were initialised is also described in section b this usually works as well as or better than pretrained embeddings in situations where you have enough data that said in a lowresource setting it can help to initialise the embedding matrix with pretrained embeddings this paper might help you explore that idea in further detail in addition your statement that current implementations dont do this is not entirely accurate while its true that the embeddings are usually jointly trained by default many existing neural mt toolkits have the option to initialise the embeddings with pretrained vectors for example opennmtpy marian

55028281,fasttext representation for short phrase but not for longer phrase containing the short one,python nlp gensim fasttext,im not certain whats causing the behavior youre seeing though i have a theory below but take note that the current gensim behavior through of sometimes returning keyerror all ngrams for word absent for an oov word does not conform to the behavior of facebooks original fasttext implementation and is thus considered a bug it should be fixed in the next release you can read a change note about the new compatible behavior so in the near future with an uptodate version of gensim you will never see this keyerror in the meantime factors that might explain your observed behavior include its not typical to pass spacedelimited phrases to fasttext further usual tokenizations of training texts will only pass wordtokens without any internal whitespace so for a typical model theres no chance such spacecontaining phrases will have fullword vectors and none of their characterngrams that contains spaces will map to ngrams seen during training either to the extent you get a vector at all in gensim and earlier it will be because some of the ngrams not containing spaces were seen in training post you will always get a vector though it may be composed from random collisions of the querywords novel ngrams with ngrams learned in training or simply with randomlyinitializedbutnevertrained vectors inside the models ngram hashtable ngrams are learned with a synthetic startofword prefix and endofword suffix specifically the characters and and the default ngram size range is from to characters so your string aum wert will among its ngrams include wert and ert all of its other ngrams will include a space character and thus couldnt possibly be in the set of ngrams learned during training on words without spaces but note that the longer phrase on which you get the error will not include the ngram ert because the prior endoftoken has been replaced with a space so the shorter phrases ngrams is not a proper subset of the larger phrases ngrams and the larger phrase could error where the shorter does not and your longer phrase without a space that does not error also includes a number of extra character ngrams that may have been in training data that the erroring phrase does not have
55018426,why the fasttext word embedding could generate the representation of a word from another language,python gensim wordembedding fasttext nlp,in fact the proper behavior for a fasttext model based on the behavior of facebooks originalreference implementation is to always return a vector for an outofvocabulary word essentially if none of the supplied strings character ngrams are present a vector will still be synthesized from whatever random vectors happen to be at the same lookup slots in the models fixedsize collection of ngram vectors in gensim up through at least the fasttext class will throw a keyerror all ngrams for word absent from model error if none of an outofvocabulary words ngrams are present but thats a buggy behavior that will be reversed to match facebooks fasttext in a future gensim release the pr to correct this behavior has been merged to gensims develop branch and thus should take effect in the next release after im not sure why youre not getting such an error with the specific model and dataset youve described perhaps your fasttextmodel was actually trained with different text than you think or trained with a verysmall nondefault minn parameter such that a single appearing inside the sentiment data is enough to contribute to a synthesized vector for but given that the standard fasttext behavior is to always report some synthesized vector and gensim will match that behavior in a future release you shouldnt count on getting an error here expect to get back an essentiallyrandom vector for completely unknown words with no resemblance to training data

54951312,desired distribution of weights in word embedding vectors,nlp wordvec fasttext,im unfamiliar with any research or folk wisdom about the desirable weights of the vectors by which i assume you mean the individual dimensions in general since the individual dimensions arent strongly interpretable im not sure you could say much about how any one dimensions values should be distributed and remember our intuitions from lowdimensional spaces d d d often dont hold up in highdimensional spaces ive seen two interesting possibly relevant observations in research some have observed that the raw trained vectors for words with singular meanings tend to have a larger magnitude and those with many meanings have smaller magnitudes a plausible explanation for this would be that wordvectors for polysemous wordtokenss are being pulled in different directions for the multiple contrasting meanings and thus wind up somewhere in the middle closer to the origin and thus of lower magnitude note though that most wordvectortowordvector comparisons ignore the magnitudes by using cosinesimilarity to only compare angles or largely equivalently by normalizing all vectors to unit length before comparisons a paper allbutthetop simple and effective postprocessing for word representations by mu bhat viswanath has noted that the average of all wordvectors that were trained together tends to biased in a certain direction from the origin but that removing that bias and other commonalities in the vectors can result in improved vectors for many tasks in my own personal experiments ive observed that the magnitude of that biasfromorigin seems correlated with the number of negative samples chosen and that choosing the extreme and uncommon value of just negative sample makes such a bias negligible but might not be best for overall quality or efficiencyspeed of training so there may be useful heuristics about vector quality from looking at the relative distributions of vectors but im not sure any would be sensitive to individual dimensions except insofar as those happen to be the projections of vectors onto a certain axis
54924582,is it possible to freeze only certain embedding weights in the embedding layer in pytorch,python nlp pytorch wordembedding glove,divide embeddings into two separate objects one approach would be to use two separate embeddings one for pretrained another for the one to be trained the glove one should be frozen while the one for which there is no pretrained representation would be taken from the trainable layer if you format your data that for pretrained token representations it is in smaller range than the tokens without glove representation it could be done lets say your pretrained indices are in the range while those without representation are i would go with something along those lines lets say your pretrained indices are in the range while those without representation are zero gradients for specified tokens this one is a bit tricky but i think its pretty concise and easy to implement so if you obtain the indices of tokens which got no glove representation you can explicitly zero their gradient after backprop so those rows will not get updated and the output of the second approach

54762478,how to use pretrained wordvec vectors in docvec model,python machinelearning nlp wordvec docvec,you might think that docvec aka the paragraph vector algorithm of mikolovle requires wordvectors as a st step thats a common belief and perhaps somewhat intuitive by analogy to how humans learn a new language understand the smaller units before the larger then compose the meaning of the larger from the smaller but thats a common misconception and docvec doesnt do that one mode pure pvdbow dm in gensim doesnt use conventional perword input vectors at all and this mode is often one of the fastesttraining and bestperforming options the other mode pvdm dm in gensim the default does make use of neighboring wordvectors in combination with docvectors in a manner analgous to wordvecs cbow mode but any wordvectors it needs will be trainedup simultaneously with docvectors they are not trained st in a separate step so theres not a easy splicein point where you could provide wordvectors from elsewhere you can mix skipgram wordtraining into the pvdbow with dbowwords in gensim but that will train wordvectors from scratch in an interleaved sharedmodel process to the extent you could preseed a model with wordvectors from elsewhere it wouldnt necessarily improve results it could easily send their quality sideways or worse it might in some lucky wellmanaged cases speed model convergence or be a way to enforce vectorspacecompatibility with an earlier vectorset but not without extra gotchas and caveats that arent a part of the original algorithms or welldescribed practices

53623432,understanding word embeddings convolutional layer and max pooling layer in lstms and rnns for nlp text classification,python tensorflow nlp lstm wordembedding,the simplest way to understand a convolution is to think of it as a mapping that tells a neural network to which features pixels in the case of where you would use a d convolution or words before or after a given word for text where you would use a d convolution are nearby without this the network has no way of knowing that words just before or just after a given word are more relevant than words that are much further away it typically also results in information being presented in a much more densely packed format thereby greatly reducing the number of parameters in your case down from million to thousand i find that this answer explains the technicality of how it works rather well max pooling is a method that downsamples your data it is often used directly after convolutions and achieves two things it again reduces the number of parameters in your case it will represent four values with a single value the max of the four values it does this by taking the first four values then taking a stride of size four and taking the next four values etc in other words there will be no overlap between the pools this is what keras does by default but you could also set the stride to for example secondly because it takes the max value in theory in sharpens the contrast between the pools by taking the maximum value instead of for example taking the average max pooling is not learnt it is just a simple arithmetic calculation that is why the number of parameters is given as zero the same for dropout an lstm expects a three dimensional input of shape number of samples number of timesteps number of features having performed the previous convolution and max pooling steps youve reduced the representation of your initial embedding to number of timesteps and number of features the first value number of samples none is a placeholder for the batch size you plan to use by initializing an lstm with units also known as hidden states you are parameterizing the size of the memory of the lstm essentially the accumulation of its input output and forget gates through time

51579761,embedding in keras,keras nlp datascience wordembedding,the short answer is neither in essence an embedding layer such as wordvec of glove is just a small neural network module fullyconnected layer usually that projects higher sparse dimensionality into a lower ndimensional vector when you insert a fresh random embedding layer in keras into your neural network keras will construct a dense learnable matrix of shape inputdim outputdim concretely lets say that youre inserting an embedding layer to encode integer scalar month information unique values into a float vector of size in keras youre going to declare your embedding as follows your embedding layer would have a summary as follows notice that the learnable parameters are the is needed by keras to encode values that dont belong to any of the unique months just in case also notice that while the input shape to embedding is shaped none the output of the embedding is shaped none this means the very small dense weight matrix of size is applied to each of the input timesteps which means every month integer input of will be converted into a float vector of size this also means that when you do backpropagation from the final layer into the embedding layer the gradient to each of the timesteps embedding output will also flow in a timedistributed manner to the small neural network weights which is essentially the embedding layer of size please also refer to official keras documentation for embedding layer

49472999,what does representation matrix of context word mean in skipgram,machinelearning nlp deeplearning stanfordnlp wordvec,before answering your question i have to add a bit of background for the sake of argument from previous slides first the optimization is on the probability of one word cooccurring with another word the center word and a context word the vector representations could be shared between these two but practically we have two collections of matrixes list of word vectors center word vectors first red matrix on the left context word vectors three red matrices in the middle the picture in this question shows how we estimate the probabilities with the multiplication of two kinds of vectors and the softmax normalization now the questions how do we get this matrix v by d dimension as it was mentioned before this can be the same matrix as word vectors but transposed or you can imagine that we learning two vectors for each word center context the context wordvectors in calculations are used in its transposed form v being the size of vocabulary and d the dimension size of the vectors these are the parameters which we want to learn from data notice how dimensions change in each matrix multiplication x is the onehot encoding of the center word w is the list of all word vectors wx multiplication basically select the right word vector out of this list the final result is a list of all possible dotproduct of context word vector and the center word vector the onehot vector of the true observed context word selects the intended results then based on the loss updates will be backpropagated through the computation flow updating w and w why these three matrix are identical but the three multiplication results are different the square and two rhombi in the middle are representing one matrix the three multiplications are happening in three different observations although they represent the same matrix on each observation parameters w and w change using backpropagations that is why the results are different on three multiplications update from chat however your expectations are valid the presentation could show exactly the same results in these multiplications because the objective function is the sum of all cooccurrence probabilities in one window

46724680,why are word embedding actually vectors,machinelearning neuralnetwork nlp wordvec embedding,what are embeddings word embedding is the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing nlp where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with much lower dimension source what is wordvec wordvec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings these models are shallow twolayer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words wordvec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space typically of several hundred dimensions with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located in close proximity to one another in the space source whats an array in computer science an array data structure or simply an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements values or variables each identified by at least one array index or key an array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula the simplest type of data structure is a linear array also called onedimensional array whats a vector vector space a vector space also called a linear space is a collection of objects called vectors which may be added together and multiplied scaled by numbers called scalars scalars are often taken to be real numbers but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers rational numbers or generally any field the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements called axioms listed below source whats the difference between vectors and arrays firstly the vector in word embeddings is not exactly the programming language data structure so its not arrays vs vectors introductory similarities and differences programmatically a word embedding vector is some sort of an array data structure of real numbers ie scalars mathematically any element with one or more dimension populated with real numbers is a tensor and a vector is a single dimension of scalars to answer the op question why are word embedding actually vectors by definition word embeddings are vectors see above why do we represent words as vectors of real numbers to learn the differences between words we have to quantify the difference in some manner imagine if we assign theses smart numbers to the words we see that the distance between fruit and apple is close but samsung and apple isnt in this case the single numerical feature of the word is capable of capturing some information about the word meanings but not fully imagine the we have two real number values for each word ie vector to compute the difference we could have done thats not very informative it returns a vector and we cant get a definitive measure of distance between the words so we can try some vectorial tricks and compute the distance between the vectors eg euclidean distance now we can see more information that apple can be closer to samsung than orange to samsung possibly thats because apple cooccurs in the corpus more frequently with samsung than orange the big question comes how do we get these real numbers to represent the vector of the words thats where the wordvec embedding training algorithms originally conceived by bengio comes in taking a detour since adding more real numbers to the vector representing the words is more informative then why dont we just add a lot more dimensions ie numbers of columns in each word vector traditionally we compute the differences between words by computing the wordbyword matrices in the field of distributional semanticsdistributed lexical semantics but the matrices become really sparse with many zero values if the words dont cooccur with another thus a lot of effort has been put into dimensionality reduction after computing the word cooccurrence matrix imho its like a topdown view of how global relations between words are and then compressing the matrix to get a smaller vector to represent each word so the deep learning word embedding creation comes from the another school of thought and starts with a randomly sometimes notso random initialized a layer of vectors for each word and learning the parametersweights for these vectors and optimizing these parametersweights by minimizing some loss function based on some defined properties it sounds a little vague but concretely if we look at the wordvec learning technique itll be clearer see more mathematical heres more resources to readup on word embeddings

46072991,how does word embedding word vectors workcreated,neuralnetwork nlp deeplearning gensim wordvec,if you are getting identical wordvectors from models that youve prepared from different text corpuses something is likely wrong in your process you may not be performing any training at all perhaps because of a problem in how the text iterable is provided to the wordvec class in that case wordvectors would remain at their initial randomlyinitialized values you should enable logging and review the logs carefully to see that sensible counts of words examples progress and incrementalprogress are displayed during the process you should also check that results for some superficial adhoc checks look sensible after training for example does modelmostsimilarhot return other wordsconcepts somewhat like hot once youre sure models are being trained on varied corpuses in which case their wordvectors should be very different from each other deciding which model is best depends on your specific goals with wordvectors you should devise a repeatable quantitative way to evaluate a model against your intended enduses this might start crudely with a few of your own manual reviews of results like looking over mostsimilar results for important words for betterworse results but should become more extensive rigorous and automated as your project progresses an example of such an automated scoring is the accuracy method on gensims wordvectors object see if supplied with a specificallyformatted file of wordanalogies it will check how well the wordvectors solve those analogies for example the questionswordstxt of googles original wordvec code release includes the analogies they used to report vector quality note though that the wordvectors that are best for some purposes like understanding text topics or sentiment might not also be the best at solving this style of analogy and viceversa if training your own wordvectors its best to choose your training corpusparameters based on your own goalspecific criteria for what good vectors will be

45531476,how to calculate a onehot encoding value into a realvalued vector,nlp deeplearning wordvec wordembedding,the wordvec algorithm itself is what incrementally learns the realvalued vector with varied dimension values in contrast to the onehot encoding these vectors are often called dense embeddings theyre dense because unlike the onehot encoding which is sparse with many dimensions and mostly zero values they have fewer dimensions and usually no zerovalues theyre an embedding because theyve embed a discrete setofwords into another continuouscoordinatesystem youd want to read the original wordvec paper for a full formal description of how the dense embeddings are made but the gist is that the dense vectors start totally random and so at first the algorithms internal neural network is useless for predicting neighboring words but each contexttarget word training example from a text corpus is tried against the network and each time the difference from the desired prediction is used to apply a tiny nudge towards a better prediction to both wordvector and internalnetworkweight values repeated many times initially with larger nudges higher learningrate then with eversmaller nudges the dense vectors rearrange their coordinates from their initial randomness to a useful relativearrangement one thats aboutasgood as possible for predicting the training text given the limits of the model itself that is any further nudge that improves predictions on some examples worsens it on others so you might as well consider training done you then read the resulting dense embedding realvalued vectors out of the model and use them for purposes other than just nearbyword prediction

37511924,evaluating vector distance measures,python scipy nlp scikitlearn distance,in general this is just a heuristic which might or not work in particular it is easy to construct a dummy metric which will win in your approach even though it is useless try out this will give you huuuuge spread even with zscore normalization of course this is a cheating example as this is non determinsitic but i wanted to show the basic counterexample and of course given your data one can construct a deterministic analogon so what you should do your metric should be treated as hyperparameter of your process you should not divide process of generating your clusteringclassification into two separate phases choosing a distance and then learning something but you should do this jointly consider your clusteringclassification distance pairs as a single model thus instead of working with kmeans you will work with kmeanseuclidean kmeansminkowsky and so on this is the only statistically supported approach you cannot construct a method of assessing general goodness of the metric as there is no such object metric quality can be only assessed in a particular task which involves fixing every other element such as a clusteringclassification method particular dataset etc once you perform such wide exhaustive evaluation check many such pairs on many datasets you might claim that given metric performes best in such range of tasks

36034454,what meaning does the length of a wordvec vector have,python nlp gensim wordvec,i think the answer you are looking for is described in the paper measuring word significance using distributed representations of words by adriaan schakel and benjamin wilson the key points when a word appears in different contexts its vector gets moved in different directions during updates the final vector then represents some sort of weighted average over the various contexts averaging over vectors that point in different directions typically results in a vector that gets shorter with increasing number of different contexts in which the word appears for words to be used in many different contexts they must carry little meaning prime examples of such insignificant words are highfrequency stop words which are indeed represented by short vectors despite their high term frequencies for given term frequency the vector length is seen to take values only in a narrow interval that interval initially shifts upwards with increasing frequency around a frequency of about that trend reverses and the interval shifts downwards both forces determining the length of a word vector are seen at work here smallfrequency words tend to be used consistently so that the more frequently such words appear the longer their vectors this tendency is reflected by the upwards trend in fig at low frequencies highfrequency words on the other hand tend to be used in many different contexts the more so the more frequently they occur the averaging over an increasing number of different contexts shortens the vectors representing such words this tendency is clearly reflected by the downwards trend in fig at high frequencies culminating in punctuation marks and stop words with short vectors at the very end figure word vector length v versus term frequency tf of all words in the hepth vocabulary note the logarithmic scale used on the frequency axis the dark symbols denote bin means with the kth bin containing the frequencies in the interval k k with k these means are included as a guide to the eye the horizontal line indicates the length v of the mean vector discussion most applications of distributed representations of words obtained through wordvec so far centered around semantics a host of experiments have demonstrated the extent to which the direction of word vectors captures semantics in this brief report it was pointed out that not only the direction but also the length of word vectors carries important information specifically it was shown that word vector length furnishes in combination with term frequency a useful measure of word significance

34870614,what does tfnnembeddinglookup function do,python tensorflow deeplearning wordembedding nlp,yes this function is hard to understand until you get the point in its simplest form it is similar to tfgather it returns the elements of params according to the indexes specified by ids for example assuming you are inside tfinteractivesession would return because the first element index of params is the second element of params index is etc similarly would return but embeddinglookup is more than that the params argument can be a list of tensors rather than a single tensor in such a case the indexes specified in ids correspond to elements of tensors according to a partition strategy where the default partition strategy is mod in the mod strategy index corresponds to the first element of the first tensor in the list index corresponds to the first element of the second tensor index corresponds to the first element of the third tensor and so on simply index i corresponds to the first element of the ith tensor for all the indexes n assuming params is a list of n tensors now index n cannot correspond to tensor n because the list params contains only n tensors so index n corresponds to the second element of the first tensor similarly index n corresponds to the second element of the second tensor etc so in the code index corresponds to the first element of the first tensor index corresponds to the first element of the second tensor index corresponds to the second element of the first tensor index corresponds to the second element of the second tensor thus the result would be

30795152,are wordvector orientations universal,nlp wordvec,as outlined in the comments orientation is not a welldefined concept in this context a traditional word vector space has one dimension for each term in order for word vectors to be compatible they will need to have the same term order this is typically not the case between different vector collections unless you build them from exactly the same documents in exactly the same order with exactly the same algorithms you could construe orientation as vectors with the same terms in the same order but the parallel to threedimensional geometry is already strained as it is its probably better to avoid this term given two collections of vectors from reasonably representative input in a known language the most frequent terms will probably have similar distributions so you could perhaps derive a mapping from one representation to another with some accuracy see zipfs law back in the long tail of rare terms you will certainly not be able to identify any useful mappings

28129365,regex tokenpattern for scikitlearn text vectorizer,regex machinelearning nlp scikitlearn tokenize,tldr if you ever write a regex over characters youre doing something wrong but it might be an acceptable hack if you write a regex over characters you need to stop immediately let me just start off by saying that this should in no way shape or form be solved by a regex most of the steps that you describe should be handle in preprocessing or postprocessing you shouldnt try to come up with a regex that filters something that starts with deleted tweet or rt you should ignore these lines in preprocessing ignore unicode then probably worth getting off the internet since literally everything on the internet and everything outside of notepad is unicode if you want to remove all unicode characters that cant be represented in ascii which is what i assume you meant then the encoding step is the place to fix this as far as ignoring http goes you should just set http as a stopword this can be passed in as another argument to the vectorizer youre using once thats done the token regex you use probably still not a case for regex but that is the interface that sklearn offers is actually very simple where the only change to be implemented here is the ignoring of numerics like mg mentioned above its worth noting that this heavy level of token removal is going to negatively affect pretty much any analysis youre trying to do if you have a decentsized corpus you shouldnt remove any tokens if its small removing stop words and using a stemmer or a lemmatizer is a good way to go but this kind of token removal is poor practice and will lead to overfitting

26602794,how to vectorize bigrams with the hashingtrick in scikitlearn,python machinelearning scipy nlp scikitlearn,firstly you must understand what the different vectorizers are doing most vectorizers are based on the bagofword approaches where documents are tokens are mapped onto a matrix from sklearn documentation countvectorizer and hashvectorizer convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts for instance these sentences the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee which had overall charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted with this rough vectorizer would become so this might be rather inefficient considering very large dataset so the sklearn devs built more efficient code one of the most important feature of sklearn is that you dont even need to load the dataset into memory before vectorizing it since its unclear what is your task i think youre sort of looking for a general use lets say youre using it for language id lets say that your input file for the training data in traintxt and your corresponding labels are bosnian portuguese spanish and slovak ie heres one way to use the countvectorizer and the naive bayes classifier the following example is from of the dsl shared task lets start from the vectorizer firstly the vectorizer takes the input file and then converts the training set into a vectorized matrix and initializes the vectorizer ie features out lets say your test documents are in testtxt which labels are spanish es and portuguese pt now you can label the test documents with the trained classifier as such out for more information of text classification possibly you might find this nltk related questionanswer useful see nltk naivebayesclassifier training for sentiment analysis to use the hashingvectorizer you need to note that it produces vector values that are negative and multinomialnaivebayes classifier dont do negative values so you would have to use another classifier as such out but do note that the results of the perceptron is worse in this small example different classifier fits different task and different features fit different vectors also different classifiers accepts different vectors there is no perfect model just better or worse

19753945,tfidfvectorizer in sklearn how to specifically include words,python machinelearning nlp scikitlearn,you are asking several separate questions let me answer them separately it is unclear to me how the words are selected from the documentation all the features in your case unigrams bigrams and trigrams are ordered by frequency in the entire corpus and then the top are selected the uncommon words are thrown out if we say maxfeatures do we always get the same if we say maxfeatures will we get the same features but an extra added yes the process is deterministic for a given corpus and a given maxfeatures you will always get the same features i fit it on some text but i know of some words that should be included for sure how to add these to the tfidfvectorizer object you use the vocabulary parameter to specify what features should be used for example if you want only emoticons to be extracted you can do the following this will return a with m stored elements in compressed sparse row format notice there are only columns one for each feature if you want the vocabulary to include the emoticons as well as the n most common features you could calculate the most frequent features first then merge them with the emoticons and revectorize like so
16823609,natural language processing converting text features into feature vectors,java nlp svm textclassification,im not sure what values your attributes can take on but perhaps this example will help you suppose we are conducting a supervised learning experiment to try to determine if a period marks the end of a sentence or not eos and neos respectively the training data came from normal sentences in a paragraph style format but were transformed to the following vector model column class endofsentence or notendofsentence columns the words surrounding the period in question columns the number of words to the leftright respectively of the period before the next reliable sentence delimiter eg or a paragraph marker column the number of spaces following the period of course this is not a very complicated problem to solve but its a nice little introduction to weka we cant just use the words as features really high dimensional space but we can take their pos part of speech tags we can also extract the length of words whether or not the word was capitalized etc so you could feed anything as testing data so long as youre able to transform it into the vector model above and extract the features used in the arff the following very small portion of arff file was used for determining whether a period in a sentence marked the end of or not as you can see each attribute can take on whatever you want it to real denotes a real number i made up lc and uc to denote upper case and lower case respectively most of the other values are pos tags you need to figure out exactly what your features are and what values youll use to representclassify them then you need to transform your data into the format defined by your arff to touch on your punctuation question lets suppose that we have sentences that all end in or you can have an attribute called punc which takes two values i didnt use because that is what is conventionally assigned when a data point is missing our you could have boolean attributes that indicates whether a character or what have you was present with or false true another example but for quality how you determine said classification is up to you but the above should get you started good luck
15777201,why vector normalization can improve the accuracy of clustering and classification,machinelearning nlp classification mahout,normalization is not always required but it rarely hurts some examples kmeans kmeans clustering is isotropic in all directions of space and therefore tends to produce more or less round rather than elongated clusters in this situation leaving variances unequal is equivalent to putting more weight on variables with smaller variance example in matlab fyi how can i detect if my dataset is clustered or unclustered ie forming one single cluster distributed clustering the comparative analysis shows that the distributed clustering results depend on the type of normalization procedure artificial neural network inputs if the input variables are combined linearly as in an mlp then it is rarely strictly necessary to standardize the inputs at least in theory the reason is that any rescaling of an input vector can be effectively undone by changing the corresponding weights and biases leaving you with the exact same outputs as you had before however there are a variety of practical reasons why standardizing the inputs can make training faster and reduce the chances of getting stuck in local optima also weight decay and bayesian estimation can be done more conveniently with standardized inputs artificial neural network inputsoutputs should you do any of these things to your data the answer is it depends standardizing either input or target variables tends to make the training process better behaved by improving the numerical condition see ftpftpsascompubneuralillcondillcondhtml of the optimization problem and ensuring that various default values involved in initialization and termination are appropriate standardizing targets can also affect the objective function standardization of cases should be approached with caution because it discards information if that information is irrelevant then standardizing cases can be quite helpful if that information is important then standardizing cases can be disastrous interestingly changing the measurement units may even lead one to see a very different clustering structure kaufman leonard and peter j rousseeuw finding groups in data an introduction to cluster analysis in some applications changing the measurement units may even lead one to see a very different clustering structure for example the age in years and height in centimeters of four imaginary people are given in table and plotted in figure it appears that a b and c are two wellseparated clusters on the other hand when height is expressed in feet one obtains table and figure where the obvious clusters are now a c and b d this partition is completely different from the first because each subject has received another companion figure would have been flattened even more if age had been measured in days to avoid this dependence on the choice of measurement units one has the option of standardizing the data this converts the original measurements to unitless variables kaufman et al continues with some interesting considerations page from a philosophical point of view standardization does not really solve the problem indeed the choice of measurement units gives rise to relative weights of the variables expressing a variable in smaller units will lead to a larger range for that variable which will then have a large effect on the resulting structure on the other hand by standardizing one attempts to give all variables an equal weight in the hope of achieving objectivity as such it may be used by a practitioner who possesses no prior knowledge however it may well be that some variables are intrinsically more important than others in a particular application and then the assignment of weights should be based on subjectmatter knowledge see eg abrahamowicz on the other hand there have been attempts to devise clustering techniques that are independent of the scale of the variables friedman and rubin the proposal of hardy and rasson is to search for a partition that minimizes the total volume of the convex hulls of the clusters in principle such a method is invariant with respect to linear transformations of the data but unfortunately no algorithm exists for its implementation except for an approximation that is restricted to two dimensions therefore the dilemma of standardization appears unavoidable at present and the programs described in this book leave the choice up to the user

12163362,using a support vector classifier with polynomial kernel in scikitlearn,python machinelearning nlp scikitlearn,in both cases you should tune the value of the regularization parameter c using grid search you cannot compare the results otherwise as a good value for c for one might yield crappy results for the other model for the polynomial kernel you can also grid search the optimal value for the degree eg or or more in that case you should grid search both c and degree at the same time edit this has something to do with the uneven distribution of class instances in my training data right or am i calling the procedure incorrectly check that you have at least samples per class to be able to do stratifiedkfold cross validation with k i think this is the default cv used by gridsearchcv for classification if you have less dont expect the model to be able to predict anything useful i would recommend at least samples per class as a somewhat arbitrary rule of thumb min bound unless you work on toy problems with less than features and a lot of regularity in the decision boundaries between classes btw please always paste the complete traceback in questions bug reports otherwise one might not have the necessary info to diagnose the right cause

8219772,how do i form a feature vector for a classifier targeted at named entity recognition,machinelearning languageagnostic nlp,there is a bag of words lexicon building step that they omit basically you have build a map from nonrare words in the training set to indicies lets say you have k unique words in your training set youll have mapping from every word in the training set to then the feature vector is basically a concatenation of a few very sparse vectors that have a corresponding to a particular word and s and then for a particular pos and other s for nonactive pos this is generally called a one hot encoding so your feature vector is about size k with a little extra for pos and char tags and is almost entirely s except for s in positions picked according to your feature to index mappings
3121217,cosine similarity of vectors of different lengths,python nlp similarity nltk tfidf,you need multiply the entries for corresponding words in the vector so there should be a global order for the words this means that in theory your vectors should be the same length in practice if one document was seen before the other words in the second document may have been added to the global order after the first document was seen so even though the vectors have the same order the first document may be shorter since it doesnt have entries for the words that werent in that vector document the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog document the runner was quick in this case in theory you need to pad the document vector with zeroes on the end in practice when computing the dot product you only need to multiply elements up to the end of vector since omitting the extra elements of vector and multiplying them by zero are exactly the same but visiting the extra elements is slower then you can compute the magnitude of each vector separately and for that the vectors dont need to be of the same length
2705888,rdf representation of sentences,nlp artificialintelligence rdf,it looks like you want the typed dependencies of a sentence eg for john likes coke im not aware of any dependency parser that directly produces rdf however many of them produce parses in a standardized tab limited representation known as conllx and it shouldnt be too hard to convert from conllx to rdf open source dependency parsers there are a number of parsers to choose from that extract typed dependencies including the following stateofart open source options stanford parser see online demo maltparser mstparser the stanford parser includes a pretrained model for parsing english to get typed dependencies youll need to use the flag outputformat typeddependencies for the maltparser you can download an english model here the mstparser includes a small sentence english training set that you can use to create youre own english parsing model however training on this little data will hurt the accuracy of the resulting parser so if you decide to use this parser you are probably better off using the pretrain model available here all of the pretrained models linked above produce parses according to the stanford dependency formalism acl paper and manual of these three the stanford parser is the most accurate the maltparser is the fastest with some configurations of this package being able to parse sentences in only seconds

69533961,how to configure and train the model using glove and cnn for text classification,python tensorflow convneuralnetwork stanfordnlp textclassification,two things that come to my mind your maxpooling layers are reducing the size of the input to the next convolutional layers every time and eventually the size is too small to run another maxpooling operation try running after each maxpooling operation and you will quickly find out that your tensor cannot be further reduced you can then consider using a different poolsize in your maxpooling layers the second thing i notice i am not sure if it is intentional but maxpoolingd global max pooling keras supports both operations take a look at the documentation on a side note sentence classification with cnns was widely popularized by the work of yoon kim in his work he shows that global maxpooling operations perform much better than striding maxpooling operations in sentence classification when using word embeddings as you are doing

36821818,svm feature vector representation by using premade dictionary for text classification,machinelearning svm sentimentanalysis textclassification,in short this is not the way it works the whole point of learning is to give classifier ability to assign these weights on their own you cannot force it to have a high value per class for a particular feature i mean you could on the optimization level but this would require changing the whole svm structure so the right way is to simply create a normal representation without any additional specification let the model decide they are better at statistical analysis than human intuition really

28644177,countvectorizer deleting features that only appear once,python machinelearning scikitlearn textclassification,so its impossible to say without actually seeing the source code of setupdata but i have a pretty decent guess as to what is going on here sklearn follows the fittransform format meaning there are two stages specifically fit and transform in the example of the countvectorizer the fit stage effectively creates the vocabulary and the transform step transforms your input text into that vocabulary space my guess is that youre calling fit on both datasets instead of just one you need to be using the same fitted version of countvectorizer on both if you want the results to line up eg again this can only be a guess until you post the setupdata function but having seen this before i would guess youre doing something more like this which will effectively make a new vocabulary for the testcorpus which unsurprisingly wont give you the same vocabulary length in both cases

79238246,do i fit tsne the two sets of embeddings from two different models at the same time or do i fit each separately then visualize and compare,graph neuralnetwork visualization wordembedding tsne,if you fit tsne separately for each embedding set youll preserve the internal structure of each embedding space as the optimization is independent however scatter plots from this method are not directly comparable because tsne outputs are nondeterministic and embedding spaces can be arbitrarily rotated flipped or scaled while you can examine clusters in isolation you wont gain insight into the relationship between the two embedding sets if you fit tsne on both embedding sets together the embeddings are projected into a shared lowdimensional space this allows direct visual comparison making it easier to observe whether embeddings from both gnns cluster similarly however this approach risks distorting the internal structure of individual embedding spaces especially if the embeddings differ significantly the tsne algorithm will balance the relationships between and within the two sets potentially introducing artifacts the choice depends on your objective for independent analysis of internal structures fit tsne separately for relational comparisons in a shared space fit tsne jointly to complement the visualization youd better include quantitative metrics like cosine similarity or cluster purity to reinforce your observations as visualizations should be treated as exploratory tools rather than conclusive evidence

76313091,should i pass wordvec and fasttext vectors separately or concatenate them for deep learning model in smart contract vulnerability detection,python deeplearning wordvec wordembedding fasttext,the generic answer for when you dont know which of multiple different ideas is better youy try them each separately see which evaluates as better on your robust repeatable evaluations if you dont have a way to evaluate which is better thats a bigger more foundational thing to address than any other choices given what youve said other observations the wordvec fasttext algorithms are very similar with the most experience supporting their use being in the fuzzy sorts of menaings inherent in naturallanguage text and the main advantage of fasttext is in being able to synthesize betterthannothing guessvectors for words that werent seen during training but might be similar in substrings that hint their meaning to other known words smart contract source code or bytecode is sufficiently unlike natural language in its narrow vocabulary token frequencies purposes rigorous execution model that its not immediately clear wordvectors could help wordvectors often have been useful with languagelike tokensets that arent naturallanguage but even there usually for discovering gradations of meaning with smart contracts the difference between works as hoped and fatally vulnerable may just be a tiny matter of a single misplaced operation or subtle missed error case those are the kind of highly contextual orderingbased outcomes that wordvectors simply do not model at best i think you might discover that competent coders tend to use mroe of certain kinds of operations or names than incompetent ones further the main advantage of fasttext synthesizing vectors for unknown but morphologicallysimilar tokens may be far less relevant for bytecodeanalysis where unknown tokens are rare or even impossible maybe if youre analyzing sourcecode including freely chosen variable names new unknown variable names will have hints of relations to previouslytrained names so wordvectors may the an improper or underpowered tool for doing the sort of highstakes subtle classification youre attempting but as with the topmost answer the only way to know test ideas of what works or not is to try each approach evaluate it in some fair repeatable way this even includes testing different ways of training the wordvectors from a single algorithm like just wordvec itself different modes parameters preprocessing etc
76299956,what is the best way to save fasttext word vectors in a dataframe as numeric values,python dataframe vector wordembedding fasttext,for further calculations usually the best approach is to not move the vectors into a dataframe at all which brings up these sorts of typesize issues and adds more indirection datastructure overhead from the dataframes tablecells model rather leave them as the numpyndarray objects they are either the individual dimension arrays or in some cases the giant numberofwords vectorsize matrix used by the fasttext model itself to store all the words using numpy functions directly on those will generally lead to the most concise efficient code with the least memory overhead for example if wordlist is a python list of the words whose vectors you want to average
76167117,how to store ndimensional vector in microsoft sql server,arrays sqlserver vector wordembedding,you may also try something like explained here there is no specific data type available to store a vector in azure sql database but we can use some human ingenuity to realize that a vector is just a list of numbers as a result we can store a vector in a table very easily by creating a column to contain vector data one row per vector element we can then use a columnstore index to efficiently store and search for vectors so create a table to hold the vectors and then we can use tsql to efficiently compute distances on that table we can create a column store index to efficiently store and search for vectors then it is just a matter of calculating the distance between vectors to find the closest thanks to the internal optimization of the columnstore that uses simd avx instructions to speed up vector operations the distance calculation is extremely fast the most common distance is the cosine similarity which can be calculated quite easily in sql the sql query is calculating the cosine similarity between two vectors represented by the columns avalue and bvalue cosine similarity is defined as follows where is the dot product of vectors and a and b are the magnitudes of vectors a and b respectively the important parts of the query are sumavalue bvalue calculates the dot product of vectors a and b sqrtsumavalue avalue calculates the magnitude of vector a sqrtsumbvalue bvalue calculates the magnitude of vector b finally the entire expression divides the dot product by the product of the magnitudes to find the cosine similarity which is returned as cosinesimilarity

73624865,embedding inside the model vs outside the model,python tensorflow keras neuralnetwork wordembedding,does it mean that if i use embedding outside the model embedding parameters are not learned during the training the dense vector representations assigned from an embedding layer are generally only trainable when setting trainabletrue its entirely up to you how you want to preprocess your data yourself and how much you want to leave to the embedding layer usually if you are working on a nlp task you can add a stringlookup or textvectorization layer prior to adding an embedding layer that allows you to preprocess your texts and train them in an elegant way without any manual steps generally each integer value fed to an embedding layer is mapped to a unique ndimensional vector representation where n is chosen by you these vector representations are by default drawn from a uniform distribution the embedding layer inherits from tfkeraslayerslayer which contains the trainable parameter i think it could make sense to generate embedding data outside your model if you are for example using pretrained contextsensitive vectors and you do not want to update their values during training but again its all up to you

70384870,rare misspelled words messes my fasttextwordembedding classfiers,python gensim sentimentanalysis wordembedding,if you train your own wordvector model then it will contain vectors for all the words you told it to learn if a word that was in your training data doesnt appear to have a vector it likely did not appear the required mincount number of times these models tend to improve if you discard rare words who few example usages may not be suitablyinformative so the default minwords is a good idea its often reasonable for downstream tasks like feature engineering using the text set of wordvectors to simply ignore words with no vector that is if somerareword in modelwv is false just dont try to use that word its missing vector for anything so you dont necessarily need to find or train a set of wordvectors with every word you need just elide rather than worryabout the rare missing words separate observations stemminglemmatization stopword removal arent always worth the trouble with all corporaalgorithmsgoals and stemminglemmatization may wind up creating pseudowords that limit the models interpretability easy application to any texts that dont go through identical preprocessing so if those are required parts of laerning exercise sure get some experience using them but dont assume theyre necessarily helping or worth the extra timecomplexity unless you verify that rigrously fasttext models will also be able to supply synthetic vectors for words that arent known to the model based on substrings these are often pretty weak but may better than nothing especially when they give vectors for typos or rare infelcted forms similar to morphologicallyrelated known words since this deduced similarity from many similarlywritten tokens provides some of the same value as stemminglemmatization via a different path that required the original variations to all be present during initial training youd especially want to pay attention to whether fasttext stemminglemmatization mix well for your goals beware though for veryshort unknown words for which the model learned no reusable substring vectors fasttext may still return an error or allzeros vector fasttext has a supervised classification mode but its not supported by gensim if you want to experiment with that youd need to use the facebook fasttext implementation you could still use a traditional nonsupervised fasttext word vector model as a contributor of features for other possible representations
70057975,how to get cosine similarity of word embedding from bert model,python bertlanguagemodel wordembedding transformermodel,okay lets do this first you need to understand that bert has layers the first layer is basically just the embedding layer that bert gets passed during the initial training you can use it but probably dont want to since thats essentially a static embedding and youre after a dynamic embedding for simplicity im going to only use the last hidden layer of bert here youre using two words new and york you could treat this as one during preprocessing and combine it into newyork or something if you really wanted in this case im going to treat it as two separate words and average the embedding that bert produces this can be described in a few steps tokenize the inputs determine where the tokenizer has wordids for new and york suuuuper important pass through bert average cosine similarity first what you need to import from transformers import autotokenizer automodel now we can create our tokenizer and our model make sure to use the model in evaluation mode unless youre trying to fine tune next we need to tokenize step step need to determine where the index of the words match the above code checks where the wordids produced by the tokenizer overlap the word indices from the original sentence this is necessary because the tokenizer splits rare words so if you have something like aardvark when you tokenize it and look at it you actually get this step pass through bert now we grab the embeddings that bert produces across the token ids that weve produced now you will have two embeddings each is shape the first size is because you have two words were looking at new and york the second size is the embedding size of bert step average okay so this isnt necessarily what you want to do but its going to depend on how you treat these embeddings what we have is two shaped embeddings you can either compare new to new and york to york or you can combine new york into an average ill just do that but you can easily do the other one if it works better for your task step cosine sim cosine similarity is pretty easy using torch this is good they point in the same direction theyre not exactly but that can be improved in several ways you can fine tune on a training set you can experiment with averaging different layers rather than just the last hidden layer like i did you can try to be creative in combining new and york i took the average but maybe theres a better way for your exact needs
69866356,fasttext producing zero vector,python spatial wordembedding fasttext,might the words for which you are receiving origin vectors all dimensions be very short shorter than the minn parameter used when the model was constructed if so thats what the model is designed to do fasttext can only synthesize vectors for oov words when the candidate word has substrings that may have received ngramvectors during earlier training if the training only created these wordfragment vectors for characterngrams of characters or more and you ask fasttext for to make a vector for an oov character word it has neither a fullword vector nor subword vectors to combine to the oov vector so it returns the zerovector the best you can do in such a situation is detect the situation before assuming the vector is nonzero probably then just ignore that unknown word with its unguessable vector entirely
69583960,training fasttext word embedding on your own corpus,python tensorflow gensim wordembedding fasttext,fasttext requires text as its training data not anything thats prevectorized as if by tfidfvectorizer if thats part of your fasttext process its misplaced the gensim fasttext support requires the training corpus as a python iterable where each item is a list of string wordtokens each listoftokens is typically some cohesive text where the neighboring words have the relationship of usage together in usual naturallanguage it might be a sentence a paragraph a post an articlechapter or whatever gensims only limitation is that each text shouldnt be more than tokens long if your texts are longer than that they should be fragmented into separate orfewer parts but dont worry too much about the loss of association around the split points in training sets sufficiently large for an algorithm like fasttext any such lossofcontexts is negligible
69336366,how do i feed an array of tokenized sentences to wordvec to get embeddings,pythonx logging wordvec wordembedding anomalydetection,if youre using the gensim library in python for its wordvec implementation it wants its corpus as a reiterable sequence where each item is itself a list of string tokens a list which itself has each item as a listofstringtokens would work your seq is close but it doesnt need to be thus probably shouldnt be a numpy array of objects each of your object items is a list good but each has only has a single untokenized string inside bad you need to break those strings into the individual words that you want the model to learn
68815926,how to combine embeddins vectors of bert with other features,python pythonx bertlanguagemodel wordembedding,there is not one perfect way to tackle this problem but a simple solution will be to concat the bert embeddings with hardcoded features the bert embeddings sentence embeddings will be of dimension if you have used bert base these embeddings can be treated as features of the sentence itself the additional features can be concatenated to form a higher dimensional vector if the features are categorical it will be ideal to convert to onehot vectors and concatenate them for example if you want to use level in your example as set of input features it will be best to convert it into onehot feature vector and then concatenate with bert embeddings however in some cases your hard coded features can be dominant feature to bias the classifier and in some other cases it can have no influence at all it all depends on the data that you have
68604006,gensim docvec produce more vectors than given documents when i pass unique integer id as tags,machinelearning gensim wordembedding docvec,if you use plain ints as your documenttags then the docvec model will allocate enough docvectors for every int up to the highest int you provide even if you dont use some of those ints this assumption that all ints up to the highest declared are used allows the code to avoid creating a redundant tag slot dictionary saving a little memory that specific potential savings is the main reason for supporting plain ints rather than unique strings as tag names any such docvectors allocated but never subject to any traiing will be randomlyinitialized the same as others but never adjusted by training if you want to use plain int tag names you should either be comfortable with this overallocation or make sure you only use all contiguous int ids from to your max id with none ununused but unless your training data is very large using unique string tags and allowing the tag slot dictionary to be created is straightforward and not too expensive in memory separately mincount is almost always a bad idea in these algorithms as discarding rare tokens tends to give better results than letting their thin example usages interfere with other training
68552107,structure of gensim word embedding corpus,gensim wordvec wordembedding corpus,both would minimally work but in the second no matter how big your window parameter the fact all texts are no more than tokens long means words will only affect their immediate neighbors thats probably not what you want theres no real harm in longer texts except to note that tokens all in the same list will appear in each others windowsized neighborhood so dont run words together that shouldnt imply any realistic use alongside each other but in largeenough corpuses even the noise of some runtogether unrelated texts wont make much difference swamped by the real relationships in the bulk of the texts each text shouldnt be more than tokens long as an internal implementation limit will cause any tokens beyond that limit to be ignored

64675228,embedding layer in neural machine translation with attention,pytorch recurrentneuralnetwork wordembedding attentionmodel sequencetosequence,according to the pytorch docs a simple lookup table that stores embeddings of a fixed dictionary and size this module is often used to store word embeddings and retrieve them using indices the input to the module is a list of indices and the output is the corresponding word embeddings in short nnembedding embeds a sequence of vocabulary indices into a new embedding space you can indeed roughly understand this as a wordvec style mechanism as a dummy example lets create an embedding layer that takes as input a total of vocabularies ie the input data only contains a total of unique tokens and returns embedded word vectors living in dimensional space in other words each word is represented as dimensional vectors the dummy data is a sequence of words with indices and in that order embedding nnembedding embeddingtorchtensor tensor gradfn you can see that each of the three words are now represented as dimensional vectors we also see that there is a gradfn function which means that the weights of this layer will be adjusted through backprop this answers your question of whether embedding layers are trainable the answer is yes and indeed this is the whole point of embedding we expect the embedding layer to learn meaningful representations the famous example of king man queen being the classic example of what these embedding layers can learn edit the embedding layer is as the documentation states a simple lookup table from a matrix you can see this by doing you will see that the first second and third rows of this matrix corresponds to the result that was returned in the example above in other words for a vocabulary whose index is n the embedding layer will simply lookup the nth row in its weights matrix and return that row vector hence the lookup table

61873516,using dropout on output of embedding layer changes array values why,python pythonx keras deeplearning wordembedding,it is how the dropout regularization works after applying the dropout the values are divided by the keeping probability in this case when you use dropout the function receives the probability of turning a neuron to zero as input eg which means it has chance of keeping any given neuron so the values remaining will be multiplied by this is called inverted dropout technique and it is done in order to ensure that the expected value of the activation remains the same otherwise predictions will be wrong during inference when dropout is not used youll notice that your dropout is and all your values have been multiplied by after you applied dropout look what happens if i divide your second output bu the first
61609929,tensorflow embedding layer vocabulary size,python tensorflow wordembedding,actually if you use tensorflowkeras you have to make sure in your corpus the tokens dont exceed the vocabularysize or the inputdim of embedding layer otherwise youll get error if you use keras then you can just change the inputdim in your embedding layer without changing anything in corpus or tokens keras will replace out of vocabulary tokens with a zero vector first of all there is an error if you use tensorflowkeras tensorflow but if i use keras i dont get any error keras keras has different implementations for embedding layer to validate that lets go to keras embedding layer for now lets just look into call function nb if you want the exact source code for keras go here and download source code but if we go to tensorflow implementation its different just to verify the call function is differently written lets design a simple network like before and observe the weight matrix the model gives the following output okay we are getting bunch of zeros but the default weightinitializer is not zeros so lets observe the weight matrix now in fact it is not all zeros so why are we getting zeros lets change our input to the model as the only in vocabulary word index for inputdim is lets pass as one of the inputs now we get nonzero vectors for the positions where we passed in short keras maps any out of vocabulary word index with a zero vector and this is reasonable as for those positions the forward pass will ensure all the contributions are nil the biases may have a role though that is a little bit counterintuitive as passing out of vocabulary tokens to the model seems an overhead rather than just removing them in the preprocessing step and bad practice but it is a good fix to test different inputdim without recalculating tokens

60076497,what does each element in an embedding mean,python wordvec featureextraction embedding wordembedding,those numbers are learned vectors that each represents a dimension that best separates each word from each other given some limiting number of dimensions normally so if one group of words tends to appear in the same context then theyd likely share a similar score on one or more dimensions for example words like north south east west are likely to be very close since they are interchangeable in many contexts the dimensions are chosen by algorithm to maximize the variance they encode and what they mean is not necessarily something we can talk about in words but imagine a bag of fridgemagnets each representing a letter of the alphabet if you shine a light on them so as to cast a shadow there will be some orientations of the letters that yield more discriminatory information in the shadows than for other orientations the dimensions in a wordembedding represent the best orientations that give light to the most discriminatory shadows sometimes these dimensions might approximate things we recognise as having direct meaning but very often they wont that being said if you collect words that do have similar functions and find the vectors from those words to other words that are the endpoint of some kind of fixed relationship say england france germany as one set of words consisting of countries and london paris berlin as another set of words consisting of the respective capitalcities you will find that the relative vectors between each country and its capital are often very very similar in both direction and magnitude this has an application for search because you can start with a new word location say argentina and by looking in the location arrived at by applying the relative hascapitalcity vector you should arrive at the word buenos aires so the raw dimensions probably have little meaning of their own but by performing these a is to b as x is to y comparisons it is possible to derive relative vectors that do have a meaning of sorts

58804843,in fasttext skipgram training what will happen if some sentences in the corpus have just one word,neuralnetwork wordvec wordembedding fasttext,theres no way to train a contextword targetword skipgram pair for such words in either context or target roles so such words cant receive trained representations only texts with at least tokens contribute anything to wordvec or fasttext wordvector training one possible exception fasttext in its supervised classification mode might be able to make use of and train vectors for such words because then even single words can be used to predict the knownlabel of training texts i suspect that such corpuses will still result in the model counting the word in its initial vocabularydiscovery scan and thus it will be allocated a vector if it appears at least mincount times and that vector will receive the usual smallrandomvector initialization but the wordvector will receive no further training so when you request the vector back after training it will be of lowquality with the only meaningful contributions coming from any char ngrams shared with other words that received real training you should consider any textbreaking process that results in singleword texts as buggy for the purposes of fasttext if those singleword texts come from another meaningful context where they were once surrounded by other contextual words you should change your textbreaking process to work in larger chunks that retain that context also note its rare for mincount to be a good idea for wordvector models at least when the training text is real naturallanguage material where wordtoken frequencies roughly follow zipfs law there will be many many occurrence or fewoccurrence words but with just one to a few example usage contexts not likely representing the true breadth and subtleties of that words real usages its nearly impossible for such words to receive good vectors that generalize to other uses of those same words elsewhere training good vectors require a variety of usage examples and just one or a few examples will practically be noise compared to the tenstohundreds of examples of other words usage so keeping these rare words instead of dropping them like a default mincount or higher in larger corpuses would do tends to slow training slow convergence settling of the model and lower the quality of the other morefrequent word vectors at the end due to the significantbutlargelyfutile efforts of the algorithm to helpfully position these many rare words

58497395,input shape error adding embedding layers to lstm,python keras lstm wordembedding,in regards to the number of samples keras automatically infers that from the input data shape xtrain in this case in terms of the use of the embedding layer the idea is to convert a matrix of integers into a vector in your case it seems like you might be essentially doing that already in the step where you populate x you might instead want to consider letting the embedding layer compute a vector for each index to do this i believe you would modify x to be of shape numofsentences numofcharspersentence where the value at each datapoint is the char index for that particular character also you might want to set the lstm returnsequences to false i believe you are only looking for the final result from that layer i hope this helps
58281876,word embeddings with multiple categorial features for a single word,python pythonx pytorch wordembedding,i am not sure what do you mean by wordvec algorithm with lstm because the original wordvec algorithm does not use lstms and uses directly embeddings to predict surrounding words anyway it seems you have multiple categorical variables to embed in the example it is word id color id and font size if you round it to integer values you have two option you can create new ids for all possible combinations of your features and use nnembedding for them there is however a risk that most of the ids will appear too sparsely in the data to learn reliable embeddings have separate embedding for each of the features then you will need to combine the embeddings for the features together you have basically three options how to do it just concatenate the embeddings and let the following layers of the network to resolve the combination choose the same embedding dimension for all features and average them i would start with this one probably add a nndense layer or two the first one with relu activation and the second without activation that will explicitly combine the embeddings for your features if you need to include continuous features that cannot be discretized you can always take the continuous features apply a layer or two on top of them and combine them with the embeddings of the discrete features
58230214,word embedding model,machinelearning deeplearning wordvec wordembedding fasttext,wordvec does not generalize to unseen words it does not even work well for wards that are seen but rare it really depends on having many many examples of word usage furthermore a you need enough context left and right but you only use company names these are too short that is likely why your embeddings perform so poorly too little data and too short texts hence it is the wrong approach for you retraining the model with the new company name is not enough you still only have one data point you may as well leave out unseen words wordvec cannot work better than that even if you retrain

57903695,gensims fasttext keyedvector out of vocab,gensim wordembedding fasttext,the keyedvectors name is as of gensim just an alias for class wordveckeyedvectors which only maintains a simple word as key to vector as value mapping you shouldnt expect fasttexts advanced ability to synthesize vectors for outofvocabulary words to appear in any modelrepresentation that doesnt explicitly claim to offer that ability i would expect a lookup of an outofvocabulary word to give a clearer keyerror rather than the indexerror youve reported but youd need to show exactly what code created the file youre loading and triggered the error and the full error stack to further guess whats going wrong in your case depending on how your modelkv file was saved you might be able to load it with retained oovvector functionality by using the class fasttextkeyedvectors instead of plain keyedvectors
57685633,should the vocabulary be restricted to the trainingset vocabulary when training an nn model with pretrained wordvec like glove,keras neuralnetwork wordembedding glove,yes it is better to restrict your vocab size because pretrained embeddings like glove have many words in them that are not very useful and so wordvec and the bigger vocab size the more ram you need and other problems select your tokens from all of your data it wont lead to a limited nongeneralizable model if your data is big enough if you think that your data does not have as many tokens as are needed then you should know things your data is not good enough and you have to gather more your model cant generate well on the tokens that it hasnt seen at training so it has no point to having many unused words on your embedding and better to gather more data to cover those words i have an answer to show how you can select a minor set of word vectors from a pretrained model in here
57264086,how to combine d token embeddings into d vectors,python tokenize gensim wordvec wordembedding,the final results of training arent really d in usual wordvecgensim terminology if youve used wordvec with its default vectorsize and you had vocabulary words then youd have vectors of dimensions each note you would never want to create such highdimensional dense embedding vectors for such a tiny vocabulary the essential benefits of such dense representations come from forcing a muchlarger set of entities into manyfewer dimensions so that they are compressed into subtle continuous meaningful relative positions against each other giving words a full continuous dimensions before wordvec training will leave the model prone to severe overfitting it could in fact then trend towards a onehotlike encoding of each word and become very good at the training task without really learning to pack related words near each other in a shared space which is the usuallydesired result of training in my experience for dimension vectors you probably want at least a count of vocabulary words if you really just care about words then youd want to use muchsmaller vectors but also remember wordvec related techniques are really meant for large data problems with many subtlyvaried training examples and just barely sometimes give meaningful results on toysized data the vectors of dimensions each are internally stored inside the wordvec model related components as a raw numpy ndarray which could be thought of as a d array or d matrix its not really a list of list unless you convert it to be that lessoptimal form though of course with pythonic polymorphism you can generally pretend it was a list of list if your gensim wordvec model is in wvmodel then the raw numpy array of learned vectors is inside the wvmodelwvvectors property though the interpretation of which row corresponds to which wordtoken depends on the wvmodelwvvocab dictionary entries as far as i can tell the tensorflow embedding class is for training your own embeddings inside tf though perhaps it can be initialized with vectors trained elsewhere its st initialization argument should the sizeofthevocabulary per your conjectured case its second is the sizeofthedesiredembeddings per your conjectured case also but as noted above this match of vocabsize and denseembeddingsize is inappropriate and the example values in the tf docs of words and dimensions would be more appropriately balanced

56333914,uses of embedding embedding layer in deep learning,deeplearning lstm recurrentneuralnetwork wordembedding,what are embedding layers they are layers which converts positive integers maybe word counts into fixed size dense vectors they learn the so called embeddings for a particular text dataset in nlp tasks why are they useful embedding layers slowly learn the relationships between words hence if you have a large enough corpus which probably contains all possible english words then vectors for words like king and queen will show some similarity in the mutidimensional space of the embedding how are used in keras the keraslayersembedding has the following configurations turns positive integers indexes into dense vectors of fixed size eg this layer can only be used as the first layer in a model when the inputdim is the vocabulary size vocabulary is the corpus of all the words used in the dataset the inputlength is the length of the input sequences whereas outputdim is the dimensionality of the output vectors the dimensions for the vector of a particular word the layer can also be used wih pretrained word embeddings like wordvec or glove are they suitable for my use case absolutely yes for sentiment analysis if we could generate a context embedding for a particular word then we could definitely increase its efficiency how can i use them in my use case follow the steps you need to tokenize the sentences maybe with keraspreprocessingtexttokenizer pad the sequences to a fixed length using keraspreprocessingsequencepadsequences this will be the inputlength parameter for the embedding layer initialize the model with embedding layer as the first layer hope this helps

53587960,what is the meaning of size of wordvec vectors gensim library,python gensim wordvec wordembedding,it is not the case that wordvec aims to represent each word in the dictionary by a vector where each element represents the similarity of that word with the remaining words in the dictionary rather given a certain target dimensionality like say the wordvec algorithm gradually trains wordvectors of dimensions to be better and better at its training task which is predicting nearby words this iterative process tends to force words that are related to be near each other in rough proportion to their similarity and even further the various directions in this dimensional space often tend to match with humanperceivable semantic categories so the famous wvking wvman wvwoman wvqueen example often works because malenessfemaleness and royalty are vaguely consistent regionsdirections in the space the individual dimensions alone dont mean anything the training process includes randomness and over time just does whatever works the meaningful directions are not perfectly aligned with dimension axes but angled through all the dimensions that is youre not going to find that a v is a genderlike dimension rather if you took dozens of alternate malelike and femalelike word pairs and averaged all their differences you might find some dimensional vectordimension that is suggestive of the gender direction you can pick any size you want but are common values when you have enough training data

52352522,how does keras d convolution layer work with word embeddings text classification problem filters kernel size and all hyperparameter,python tensorflow keras convneuralnetwork wordembedding,i would try to explain how dconvolution is applied on a sequence data i just use the example of a sentence consisting of words but obviously it is not specific to text data and it is the same with other sequence data and timeseries suppose we have a sentence consisting of m words where each word has been represented using word embeddings now we would like to apply a d convolution layer consisting of n different filters with kernel size of k on this data to do so sliding windows of length k are extracted from the data and then each filter is applied on each of those extracted windows here is an illustration of what happens here i have assumed k and removed the bias parameter of each filter for simplicity as you can see in the figure above the response of each filter is equivalent to the result of its convolution ie elementwise multiplication and then summing all the results with the extracted window of length k ie ith to ikth words in the given sentence further note that each filter has the same number of channels as the number of features ie wordembeddings dimension of the training sample hence performing convolution ie elementwise multiplication is possible essentially each filter is detecting the presence of a particular feature of pattern in a local window of training data eg whether a couple of specific words exist in this window or not after all the filters have been applied on all the windows of length k we would have an output of like this which is the result of convolution as you can see there are mk windows in the figure since we have assumed that the paddingvalid and stride default behavior of convd layer in keras the stride argument determines how much the window should slide ie shift to extract the next window eg in our example above a stride of would extract windows of words instead the padding argument determines whether the window should entirely consists of the words in training sample or there should be paddings at the beginning and at the end this way the convolution response may have the same length ie m and not mk as the training sample eg in our example above paddingsame would extract windows of words pad mmm mm pad you can verify some of the things i mentioned using keras model summary as you can see the output of convolution layer has a shape of mkn and the number of parameters ie filters weights in the convolution layer is equal to numfilters kernelsize nfeatures onebiasperfilter n k embdim n

50408740,gensim docvec im gettting different vectors from documents that are identical,python gensim wordembedding docvec,the algorithm paragraph vector behind docvec makes use of randomness during initialization and training training also never reaches a point where all adjustments stop just a point where its believed that further updates will have negligible net value so identical texts wont achieve identical vectors theyre each being updated alongside the models internals with each training cycle against a slightlydifferent base model with slightly different randomization choices if you have enough data good parameters and are engaging in enough training they should become very close and your downstream evaluationsuses should be tolerant of such small variances similarly two runs on the same corpus wont result in identical endvectors unless extreme care is taken to force determinism for example by limiting training to a single worker thread so that os thread scheduling unpredictability doesnt slightly change the order of training examples so vectors should only be compared if they were cotrained together in the same model and again downstream applications should be tolerant of slight jitter from run to run or example to example other notes about your setup mincount is almost always a bad choice words with single or few examples just add noise to the training making resulting vectors worse stochastic gradient descent optimization typically ends after the learningrate alpha has been smoothly reduced to a tiny nearzero value such as youre using a final alpha thats a full of the starting alpha you may also want to save your models using gensims native save because savewordvecformat discards most model internals and squashes the docvectors into the same namespace as any wordvectors

49717440,how to measure the word weight using docvec vector,python algorithm wordembedding docvec,lets say you can find the vector r corresponding to an entire document using docvec lets also assume that using wordvec you can find the vector v corresponding to any word w as well and finally lets assume that r and v are in the same ndimensional space assuming all this you may then utilize plain old vector arithmetic to find out some correlations between r and v for starters you can normalize v normalizing after all is just dividing each dimension with the magnitude of v ie v lets call the normalized version of v as vnormal then you may project vnormal onto the line represented by the vector r that projection operation is just finding the dot product of vnormal and r right lets call that scalar result of the dot product as lenprojection well you can consider lenprojection vnormal as an indication of how parallel the context of the word is to that of the overall document in fact considering just lenprojection is enough because in this case as vnormal is normalized vnormal now you may apply this procedure to all words in the document and consider the words that lead to greatest lenprojection values as the most significant words of that document note that this method may end up finding frequentlyused words like i or and as the most important words in a document as such words appear in many different contexts if that is an issue you would want to remedy you may want do a postprocessing step to filter such common words i sort of thought of this method on the spot here and i am not sure whether this approach has any scientific backing but it may make sense if you think about how most vector embeddings for words work word vectors are usually trained to represent the context in which a word is used thinking in terms of vector arithmetic projecting the vector onto a line may reveal how parallel the context of that word w is to the overall context represented by that line last but not least as i have worked only with wordvec before i am not sure if docvec and wordvec data can be used adjointly like i mentioned above as i stated in the first paragraph of my answer it is really critical that r and v has to be in the same ndimensional space

47485216,how does maskzero in keras embedding layer work,python machinelearning keras wordembedding,actually setting maskzerotrue for the embedding layer does not result in returning a zero vector rather the behavior of the embedding layer would not change and it would return the embedding vector with index zero you can confirm this by checking the embedding layer weights ie in the example you mentioned it would be mlayersgetweights instead it would affect the behavior of the following layers such as rnn layers if you inspect the source code of embedding layer you would see a method called computemask this output mask will be passed as the mask argument to the following layers which support masking this has been implemented in the call method of base layer layer and this makes the following layers to ignore ie does not consider in their computations this inputs steps here is a minimal example as you can see the outputs of the lstm layer for the second and forth timesteps are the same as the output of first and third timesteps respectively this means that those timesteps have been masked update the mask will also be considered when computing the loss since the loss functions are internally augmented to support masking using weightedmaskedobjective when compiling the model you can verify this using the following example

46898402,do word vectors mean anything on their own,machinelearning datascience wordvec textanalysis wordembedding,the individual coordinates such as dimension of a dimensional vector etc dont have easily interpretable meanings its primarily the relative distances to other words neighborhoods and relative directions with respect to other constellations of words orientations without regard to the perpendicular coordinate axes that may be vaguely interpretable because they correlate with naturallanguage or naturalthinking semantics further the pretraining initialization of the model and much of the training itself uses randomization so even on the exact same data words can wind up in different coordinates on repeated training runs the resulting wordvectors should after each run be about as useful with respect to each other in terms of distances and directions but neighborhoods like words describing seasons or things that are hot could be in very different places in subsequent runs only vectors that trained together are comparable there are some constrained variants of wordvec that try to force certain dimensions or directions to be more useful for certain purposes such as answering questions or detecting hypernymhyponym relationships but that requires extra constraints or inputs to the training process plain vanilla wordvec wont be as cleanly interpretable

42501035,questions about word embeddingwordvec,neuralnetwork wordvec wordembedding,first why wordvec model is loglinear model because it uses a soft max at output layer exactly softmax is a loglinear classification model the intent is to obtain values at the output that can be considered a posterior probability distribution second why wordvec removes hidden layer it just because of computational complexity third why wordved dont use activation function compare for nnlmneural network language model i think your second and third question are linked in the sense that an extra hidden layer and an activation function would make the model more complex than necessary note that while no activation is explicitly formulated we could consider it to be a linear classification function it appears that the dependencies that the wordvec models try to model can be achieved with a linear relation between the input words adding a nonlinear activation function allows the neural network to map more complex functions which could in turn lead to fit the input onto something more complex that doesnt retain the dependencies wordvec seeks also note that linear outputs dont saturate which facilitates gradientbased learning
40345607,how does finetuning word embeddings work,machinelearning deeplearning wordembedding,yes if you feed the embedding vector as your input you cant finetune the embeddings at least easily however all the frameworks provide some sort of an embeddinglayer that takes as input an integer that is the class ordinal of the wordcharacterother input token and performs a embedding lookup such an embedding layer is very similar to a fully connected layer that is fed a onehot encoded class but is way more efficient as it only needs to fetchchange one row from the matrix on both front and back passes more importantly it allows the weights of the embedding to be learned so the classic way would be to feed the actual classes to the network instead of embeddings and prepend the entire network with a embedding layer that is initialized with wordvec glove and which continues learning the weights it might also be reasonable to freeze them for several iterations at the beginning until the rest of the network starts doing something reasonable with them before you start fine tuning them

70085180,is it possible to export and use a spacy ner model without an vocab and inject tokensvectors on the fly,python spacy,in spacy v not v there are some hidden background steps that register the vectors globally under a particular name for use as features in the statistical models the idea behind this is that multiple models in the same process can potentially share the same vectors in ram to get a subset of vectors to work for a particular text you need to register the new vectors under the right name use the same vectorsname as in the model metadata when creating the vectors will be something like encoreweblgvectors run spacymllinkvectorstomodelsvocab im pretty sure that this will start printing warnings and renaming the vectors internally based on the data shape if you do it repeatedly for different sets of vectors with the same name i think you can ignore the warnings and it will work for that individual text but it may break any other models loaded in the same script that are using that same vectors nameshape if you are doing this a lot in practice you might want to write a custom version of linkvectorstomodels that iterates over the words in the vocab more efficiently for very small vector tables or only modifies the words in the vocab that you know that you need it really depends on the size of the vocab at the point where youre running linkvectorstomodels

56032676,how does a nltktreetree object generate a string representation of the tree,python nltk,to be clear i supposed the question is asking why is it that the input to the tree object in nltk are integers but when printing the representation prints out the the string without raising any errors lets dig a little into the code the part that prints out the tree in humanreadable bracketed parse format is the str function at if we take closer look it calls the pformat function the pformat function at if we look at how the string s variable is created in the pformat function we see multiple use of unicoderepr thats where the inputs are converted to string inside the pformat when printing but the child and values in the tree object still remains the same type as they were input now if we look at unicoderepr in nltktreepy we see it comes from nltkcompat from in python the nltkcompatunicoderepr simply returns the repr thats by default in unicode specifically utf iirc but in python it first checks whether the object has a unicoderepr monkeypatch function then it checks its a type of texttype from the six library if so itll print out the output without the u prefix eg u finally its python and the object doesnt have a unicoderepr and isnt a sixtexttype itll simply prints out the reprobj so going back to the question in the case where the the object is an integer the reprint will be converted into a string

66112442,why the context vector is not passed to every input of the decoder,deeplearning seqseq encoderdecoder,this is a vanilla encoderdecoder model without attention there is no context vector which is how the output of the attention mechanism is called after reading the sentence abc the lstm state should contain the information about the entire input sequence so we can start decoding as a first word we decode the word w and feed it as input in the next step where we decoder the word x and so on the lstm is not fed with a context vector but with an embedding of the respective word the decoder must always get the previous word simply because it does not know what word was decoded in the previous step the lstm state is projected to the vocabulary size and we have a distribution over all possible words and any word from the distribution can be sampled and put on the input in the next step
64204703,how does nnembedding for developing an encoderdecoder model works,machinelearning pytorch attentionmodel seqseq encoderdecoder,answering the last bit first yes we do need embedding or an equivalent at least when dealing with discrete inputs eg letters or words of a language because these tokens come encoded as integers eg a b etc but those numbers do not carry meaning the letter b is not like a but more which its original encoding would suggest so we provide the embedding so that the network can learn how to represent these letters by something useful eg making vowels similar to one another in some way during the initialization the embedding vector are sampled randomly in the same fashion as other weights in the model and also get optimized with the rest of the model it is also possible to initialize them from some pretrained embeddings eg from wordvec glove fasttext but caution must then be exercised not to destroy them by backprop through randomly initialized model embeddings are not stricly necessary but it would be very wasteful to force network to learn that items is very similar to values but completely different to japan and it would probably not even remotely converge anyway

56938158,how to have a lstm autoencoder model over the whole vocab prediction while presenting words as embedding,tensorflow keras lstm autoencoder seqseq,your questions is it doable to change the structure of the model in a way i have embedding for representing my words to the model and at the same time having vocabsize in the decoder layer i like to use as reference the tensorflow transformer model in language translation tasks the model input tends to be a token index which then is subject to an embedding lookup resulting in a shape of sequencelength embeddingdims the encoder itself works on this shape the decoder output tends to be in the shape of sequencelength embeddingdims also for instance the model above then transforms the decoder output into logits by doing a dot product between the output and the embedding vectors this is the transformation they use i would recommend an approach similar to the language translation models prestage inputshapesequencelength ie tokenindex in vocabsize encoder inputshapesequencelength embeddingdims outputshapelatentdims decoder inputshapelatentdims outputshapesequencelength embeddingdims preprocessing converts token indexes into embeddingdims this can be used to generate both the encoder input as well as the decoder targets post processing to convert embeddingdims to logits in the vocabindex space i need to have outputshape of encoder layer be latentsize vocabsize and at the same time i dont want to represent my features as the onehot encoding for the obvious reason that doesnt sound right typically what one is trying to achieve with an autoencoder is to have a embedding vector for the sentence so the output of the encoder in typically latentdims the output of the decoder needs to be translatable into sequencelength vocabindex which is typically done by converting from embedding space to logits and then taking the argmax to convert to token index
49478956,reusing embedding variable for inference in the tfestimator api,python tensorflow tensorflowestimator seqseq,i figured out a solution based on the following stackoverflow answer for the prediction phase you can use the tfcontribframeworkloadvariable to retrieve the embedding variable from a trained and saved tensorflow model as follows so in my case i was running the code from the same folder containing the saved model and my variable name was embedembedding note that this only works with embeddings trained via a tensorflow model otherwise refer to the answer linked above to find the variable name using the estimator api you can use the method getvariablenames to get a list of all the variable names saved in the graph
49656630,converting a sentence to an embedding representation,wordvec sentencesimilarity,the way you describe option makes it sound like each word becomes a single number that wouldnt work the simple approach thats often used is to average all wordvectors for words in the sentence together so with dimensional wordvectors you still wind up with a dimensional sentenceaverage vector perhaps thats what you mean by your option sometimes all vectors are normalized to unitlength before this operation but sometimes not because the nonnormalized vector lengths can sometimes indicate the strength of a words meaning sometimes wordvectors are weighted by some other frequencybased indicator of their relative importance such as tfidf ive never seen your option used and dont quite understand what you mean or how it could possibly work your option would be better described as concatenating the wordvectors it gives differentsized vectors depending on the number of words in the sentence slight differences in word placement such as comparing get out of here and of here get out would result in very different vectors that usual methods of comparing vectors like cosinesimilarity would not detect as being close at all so it doesnt make sense and ive not seen it used so only your option as properly implemented to weightedaverage wordvectors is a good baseline for sentencesimilarities but its still fairly basic and there are many other ways to compare sentences using textvectors here are just a few one algorithm closely related to wordvec itself is called paragraph vectors and is often called docvec it uses a very wordveclike process to train vectors for full ranges of text whether theyre phrases sentences paragraphs or documents that work kind of like floating documentid words over the full text it sometimes offers a benefit over just averaging wordvectors and in some modes can produce both docvectors and wordvectors that are also comparable to each other if your interest isnt just pairwise sentence similarities but some sort of downstream classification task then facebooks fasttext refinement of wordvec has a classification mode where the wordvectors are trained not just to predict neighboring words but to be good at predicting known text classes when simply addedaveraged together textvectors constructed from such classification vectors might be good at similarities too depending on how well the trainingclasses capture salient contrasts between texts another way to compute pairwise similarities using just wordvectors is word movers distance rather than averaging all the wordvectors for a text together into a single textvector it considers each wordvector as a sort of pile of meaning compared to another sentence it calculates the minimum routing work distance along lots of potential wordtoword paths to move all the piles from one sentence into the configuration of another sentence it can be expensive to calculate but usually represents sentencecontrasts better than the simple singlevectorsummary that naive wordvector averaging achieves
30142345,wordvec sum or average word embeddings,cosinesimilarity wordvec sentencesimilarity,cosine measures the angle between two vectors and does not take the length of either vector into account when you divide by the length of the phrase you are just shortening the vector not changing its angular position so your results look correct to me

21679586,find similarity measure for feature vectors having different length,java similarity textprocessing,as someone already commented a possible alternative would be the levenshtein distance also sometimes referred to as the edit distance the levenshtein distance is a function which assigns to every pair of strings a and b a natural number n which represents the minimum number of operations need to transform a to b the allowed operations are delete a symbol from a insert a symbol into a replace a symbol in a note that the edit distance is symmetric as for any sequence of operations that transforms a to b it is possible to construct an inverted sequence of operations which transforms b to a the wikipedia article on the levenshtein distance lists some useful properties finally as an example lets transform your two vectors we found a sequence of operations if we manage to prove that there are no shorter sequences then we could conclude that the distance between v and v is well considering that the levenshtein distance is always at least the difference in size between the two strings think about why that is then we have our conclusion hope this helps

56207168,subsetting a character vector column into multiple columns,r dplyr textmining tidyr datamanipulation,i was pretty convinced that extract wouldnt work but it does with the right regex its really not that much more succinct than your first solution but i think it is probably about as succinct as it can get if you want to shorten things think about collapsing your colors into a two element character vector rather than a dataframe with a list column the issue with your regex pattern is your use of you want to target collections of words and not x or y or z which is what your pattern does and is why you only get one match per row to create a collection of possible matches use include for zero or more matches using your example data above librarytidyverse colours mutateall mapall strc collapse extractall ccool warm neutral blue green red pink yellow gold orange ivory brown beige remove f include the column output a tibble x all cool warm neutral blue green red pink yellow gold orange ivory brown beige green red pink orange ivory beige the main caveat is that the color categories need to be in the right order ie the string has to contain groups of color words in the order cool warm neutral if theyre random it wont work in fact i dont think extract would work anymore if the color words were random because theres no way to extract individual words and then concatenate them you also lose your list columns if thats important to you if the order isnt guaranteed or if there is a possibility that some category words are missing then you could do something like the following using a random sample of category words note that i drop the list columns so you can see whats happening colrand tribble all samplecbluegreen red pink yellow gold orange ivory brown beige samplecgreen red pink orange ivory beige mutateall mapall strc collapse unlist output a tibble x all blue yellow red beige pink ivory pink beige orange and with the following patterns patts ccool bluegreen warm redpinkyellowgoldorange neutral ivorybrownbeige you could do something like the following which extracts matches and concatenates them or returns na if there are no matches librarymagrittr unlistcolrandall mapdfrfunctionx strextractallx patts mapfunctionx ifelselengthx na strcx collapse bindcols setcolnamesnamespatts bindcolscolrand output a tibble x all cool warm neutral blue yellow red beige pink blue yellow red pink beige ivory pink beige orange na pink orange ivory beige note that the magrittr library is loaded for the setcolnames if you load magrittr after tidyversetidyr youll need to use tidyrextract above because both libraries have an extract function

50564928,how to use sentence vectors from docvec in keras sequntial model for sentence sentiment analysis,python keras deeplearning sentimentanalysis,you are already converting the sentences to vectors and reattempting it with the keras model its complaining that your embedding layer is not receiving correct indices because its already embedded assuming you have vecshape samples docvecvectorsize youll need to remove embedding because its already embedded and lstm because you now have vector per sentence not per word
44306123,what information in document vectors makes sentiment prediction work,machinelearning sentimentanalysis gensim featureselection docvec,this is less a question about docvec than about machinelearning principles with highdimensional data your approach is collapsing dimensions to a single dimension the distance to your random point then youre hoping that single dimension can still be predictive and roughly all logisticregression can do with that singlevalued input is try to pick a thresholdnumber that when your distance is on one side of that threshold predicts a class and on the other side predicts notthatclass recasting that singlethresholddistance back to the original dimensional space its essentially trying to find a hypersphere around your random point that does a good job collecting all of a single class either inside or outside its volume what are the odds your randomlyplaced centerpoint plus one adjustable radius can do that well in a complex highdimensional space my hunch is not a lot and your results no better than random guessing seems to suggest the same the logisticregression with access to the full dimensions finds a discriminatingfrontier for assigning the class thats described by coefficients and one interceptvalue and all of those values free parameters can be adjusted to improve its classification performance in comparison your alternative logisticregression with access to only the one distancefromarandompoint dimension can pick just one coefficient for the distance and an interceptbias its got th as much information to work with and only free parameters to adjust as an analogy consider a much simpler space the surface of the earth pick a random point like say the south pole if i then tell you that you are in an unknown place miles from the south pole can you answer whether you are more likely in the usa or china hardly both of those classes of location have lots of instances miles from the south pole only in the extremes will the distance tell you for sure which class country youre in because there are parts of the usas alaska and hawaii further north and south than parts of china but even there you cant manage well with just a single threshold youd need a rule which says less than x or greater than y in usa otherwise unknown the dimensional space of docvec vectors or other rich data sources will often only be sensibly divided by far more complicated rules and our intuitions about distances and volumes based on or dimensional spaces will often lead us astray in high dimensions still the earth analogy does suggest a way forward there are some reference points on the globe that will work way better when you know the distance to them at deciding if youre in the usa or china in particular a point at the center of the us or at the center of china would work really well similarly you may get somewhat better classification accuracy if rather than a random fixvec you pick either a any point for which a class is already known or b some average of all known points of one class in either case your fixvec is then likely to be in a neighborhood of similar examples rather than some random spot that has no more essential relationship to your classes than the south pole has to northernhemisphere temperatezone countries also alternatively picking n multiple random points and then feeding the n distances to your regression will preserve more of the informationshape of the original docvec data and thus give the classifier a better chance of finding a useful separatingthreshold two would likely do better than your one distance and might approach or surpass the original dimensions finally some comment about the docvec aspect docvec optimizes vectors that are somewhatgood within their constrained model at predicting the words of a text positivesentiment words tend to occur together as do negativesentiment words and so the trained docvectors tend to arrange themselves in similar positions when they need to predict similarmeaningwords so there are likely to be neighborhoods of the docvector space that correlate well with predominantly positivesentiment or negativesentiment words and thus positive or negative sentiments these wont necessarily be two giant neighborhoods positive and negative separated by a simple boundary or even a small number of neighborhoods matching our ideas of d solid volumes and many subtleties of communication such as sarcasm referencing a notheld opinion to critique it spending more time on negative aspects but ultimately concluding positive etc mean incursions of alternatesentiment words into texts a fullylanguagecomprehending human agent could understand these to conclude the true sentiment while these wordoccurrence based methods will still be confused but with an adequate model and the right number of free parameters a classifier might capture some generalizable insight about the highdimensional space in that case you can achieve reasonablygood predictions using the docvec dimensions as youve seen with the results on the full dimensional vectors

76265747,computing the cosine similarity of embeddings generated by the dolly model on the hugging face hub,python numpy huggingfacetransformers valueerror,theres a couple of things happening here dollyvb gives you multiple embeddings for a given text input where the number of embeddings depends on the input you provide for example while the model provides embeddings also called vectors for the first sentence in dataset it provides embeddings for the subsequent cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors the code you provided tries to compare multiple vectors of one sentence with multiple vectors of another sentence which violates the aforementioned operation that cosine similarity performs therefore before performing the similarity computations we need to condense the embeddings into a single vector the code below uses a technique called vector averaging which simply computes the average of the vectors its required to call npaverage which is used for vector averaging and npnormalize for each sentence individually in dataset the code below runs without error and returns a cosine similarity of for the first comparison where we compare the sentence to itself which is expected moreover the undefined npnan angular difference between the two identical vectors of the first comparison also makes sense

66820943,how to get word embeddings from the pretrained transformers,python tensorflow huggingfacetransformers transferlearning transformermodel,joining subword embeddings into words for word labeling is not how this problem is usually approached the usual approach is the opposite keep the subwords as they are but adjust the labels to respect the tokenization of the pretrained model one of the reasons is that the data is typically in batches when merging subwords into words every sentence in the batch would end up having a different length which would require processing each sentence independently and pad the batch again this would be slow also if you do not average the neighboring embeddings you get more finegrained information from the loss function which tells explicitly what subword is responsible for an error when tokenizing using sentencepiece you can get the indices in the original string from transformers import xlmrobertatokenizerfast tokenizer xlmrobertatokenizerfastfrompretrainedxlmrobertabase tokenizerdeception master returnoffsetsmappingtrue this returns the following dictionary with the offsets you can find out if the subword corresponds to a word that you want to label there are various strategies that could be used for encoding the labels the easiest one is just to copy the label to every subword a more fancy way would be using schemes used in named entity recognition such as iob tagging that explicitly says what is the begging of the labeled segment

63461262,bert sentence embeddings from transformers,bertlanguagemodel huggingfacetransformers,while the existing answer of jindrich is generally correct it does not address the question entirely the op asked which layer he should use to calculate the cosine similarity between sentence embeddings and the short answer to this question is none a metric like cosine similarity requires that the dimensions of the vector contribute equally and meaningfully but this is not the case for bert weights released by the original authors jacob devlin one of the authors of the bert paper wrote im not sure what these vectors are since bert does not generate meaningful sentence vectors it seems that this is doing average pooling over the word tokens to get a sentence vector but we never suggested that this will generate meaningful sentence representations and even if they are decent representations when fed into a dnn trained for a downstream task it doesnt mean that they will be meaningful in terms of cosine distance since cosine distance is a linear space where all dimensions are weighted equally however that does not mean you can not use bert for such a task it just means that you can not use the pretrained weights outofthebox you can either train a classifier on top of bert which learns which sentences are similar using the cls token or you can use sentencetransformers which can be used in an unsupervised scenario because they were trained to produce meaningful sentence representations

58144336,how to mask the inputs in an lstm autoencoder having a repeatvector layer,keras lstm masking,each layer in keras has an inputmask and outputmask the mask was already lost right after the first lstm layer when returnsequence false in your example let me explain this in following example and show solutions to achieve masking in lstmautoencoder as you can see above the second lstm layer returnsequencefalse returns a none which makes sense because the timesteps are lost shape are changed and the layer doesnt know how to pass the mask you can also check the source code and you will see that it returns the inputmask if returnsequencetrue otherwise none another problem is of course the repeatvector layer this layer doesnt support masking explicitly at all again this is because the shape has changed except this bottleneck part the second lstm repeatvector other parts of the model are able to pass the mask so we only have to deal with the bottleneck part here are possible solutions i will also validate based on calculating the loss first solution ignore the timesteps explicitly by passing sampleweight second solution make a customized bottleneck layer to pass the mask manually as we can already see the masks are now passed successfully to the output layer we will also validate that the loss do not include the masked timesteps
58142582,error dimensionmismatchmatrix a has dimensions vector b has length using flux in julia,machinelearning julia lstm fluxjl,introduction first off you should know that from an architectural standpoint you are asking something very difficult from your network softmax renormalizes outputs to be between and weighted like a probability distribution which means that asking your network to output values like to match y will be impossible thats not what is causing the dimension mismatch but its something to be aware of im going to drop the softmax at the end to give the network a fighting chance especially since its not whats causing the problem debugging shape mismatches lets walk through what actually happens inside of fluxtrain the definition is actually surprisingly simple ignoring everything that doesnt matter to us we are left with therefore lets start by pulling the first element out of your data and splatting it into your loss function you didnt specify your loss function or optimizer in the question although softmax usually means you should use crossentropy loss your y values are very much not probabilities and so if we drop the softmax we can just use the deadsimple mse loss for optimizer well default to good old adam now to simulate the first run of fluxtrain we take firstdata and splat that into loss this gives us the error message youve seen before error dimensionmismatchmatrix a has dimensions vector b has length looking at our data we see that yes indeed the first element of our dataset has a length of and so we will change our model to instead expect values instead of and now we rerun huzzah it worked we can run this again the value changes because the rnn holds memory within itself which gets updated each time we run the network otherwise we would expect the network to give the same answer for the same inputs the problem comes however when we try to run the second training instance through our network understanding lstms this is where we run into machine learning problems more than programming problems the issue here is that we have promised to feed that first lstm network a vector of length well now and we are breaking that promise this is a general rule of deep learning you always have to obey the contracts you sign about the shape of the tensors that are flowing through your model now the reasons youre using lstms at all is probably because you want to feed in ragged data chew it up then do something with the result maybe youre processing sentences which are all of variable length and you want to do sentiment analysis or somesuch the beauty of recurrent architectures like lstms is that they are able to carry information from one execution to another and they are therefore able to build up an internal representation of a sequence when applied upon one time point after another when building an lstm layer in flux you are therefore declaring not the length of the sequence you will feed in but rather the dimensionality of each time point imagine if you had an accelerometer reading that was points long and gave you x y z values at each time point to read that in you would create an lstm that takes in a dimensionality of then feed it times writing our own training loop i find it very instructive to write our own training loop and model execution function so that we have full control over everything when dealing with time series its often easy to get confused about how to call lstms and dense layers and whatnot so i offer these simple rules of thumb when mapping from one time series to another eg constantly predict future motion from previous motion you can use a single chain and call it in a loop for every input time point you output another when mapping from a time series to a single output eg reduce sentence to happy sentiment or sad sentiment you must first chomp all the data up and reduce it to a fixed size you feed many things in but at the end only one comes out were going to rearchitect our model into two pieces first the recurrent pacman section where we chomp up a variablelength time sequence into an internal state vector of predetermined length then a feedforward section that takes that internal state vector and reduces it down to a single output the reason we split it up into two pieces like this is because the problem statement wants us to reduce a variablelength input series to a single number were in the second bullet point above so our code naturally must take this into account we will write our lossx y function to instead of calling modelx it will instead do the pacman dance then call the reducer on the output note that we also must reset the rnn state so that the internal state is cleared for each independent training example feeding this into fluxtrain actually trains albeit not very well final observations although your data is all ints its pretty typical to use floating point numbers with everything except embeddings an embedding is a way to take nonnumeric data such as characters or words and assign numbers to them kind of like ascii if youre dealing with text youre almost certainly going to be working with some kind of embedding and that embedding will dictate what the dimensionality of your first lstm is whereupon your inputs will all be onehot encoded softmax is used when you want to predict probabilities its going to ensure that for each input the outputs are all between and moreover that they sum to like a good little probability distribution should this is most useful when doing classification when you want to wrangle your wild network output values of into something where you can say we have certainty that the second class is correct and certainty its the third class when training these networks youre often going to want to batch multiple time series at once through your network for hardware efficiency reasons this is both simple and complex because on one hand it just means that instead of passing a single sx vector through where s is the size of your embedding youre instead going to be passing through an sxn matrix but it also means that the number of timesteps of everything within your batch must match because the sxn must remain the same across all timesteps so if one time series ends before any of the others in your batch you cant just drop it and thereby reduce n halfway through a batch so what most people do is pad their timeseries all to the same length good luck in your ml journey

52627739,how to merge numerical and embedding sequential models to treat categories in rnn,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,one solution as you mentioned is to onehot encode the categorical data or even use them as they are in indexbased format and feed them along the numerical data to an lstm layer of course you can also have two lstm layers here one for processing the numerical data and another for processing categorical data in onehot encoded format or indexbased format and then merge their outputs another solution is to have one separate embedding layer for each of those categorical data each embedding layer may have its own embedding dimension and as suggested above you may have more than one lstm layer for processing numerical and categorical features separately here is the model summary yet there is another solution which you can try just have one embedding layer for all the categorical features it involves some preprocessing though you need to reindex all the categories to make them distinct from each other for example the categories in first categorical feature would be numbered from to sizefirstcat and then the categories in the second categorical feature would be numbered from sizefirstcat to sizefirstcat sizesecondcat and so on however in this solution all the categorical features would have the same embedding dimension since we are using only one embedding layer update now that i think about it you can also reshape the categorical features in data preprocessing stage or even in the model to get rid of timedistributed layers and the reshape layer and this may increase the training speed as well model summary layer type output shape param connected to catinput inputlayer none catinput inputlayer none catinput inputlayer none embedding embedding none catinput embedding embedding none catinput embedding embedding none catinput numericinput inputlayer none concatenate concatenat none embedding e embedding embedding concatenate concatenat none numericinput e concatenate lstm lstm none concatenate total params kb trainable params kb nontrainable params byte as for fitting the model you need to feed each input layer separately with its own corresponding numpy array for example if you would like to use fitgenerator there is no difference
52473530,gensim docvec dimensional vector fed into keraslstm model not workingloss is not diminishing,neuralnetwork keras lstm recurrentneuralnetwork,as discussed in the comments the problem lies in the large batch size and maybe also in the optimizer used for the training it is hard to determine an exact reason why your algorithm did not converge with the current settings but it can be argued as such large batch sizes have a slower convergence counterintuitively training with larger batch sizes will actually in some instances slow down your training the reason behind this is purely speculative and depends on the exact nature and distribution of your data generally though having a smaller batch size means having more frequent updates if your calculated gradients all point in a similar direction having these more frequent updates will lead to a faster convergence good practice is to have a batch size that is never larger than in most scenarios is a good rule of thumb and a nice tradeoff between the speed advantage of larger batches and the nice convergence properties of smaller batch sizes note that this only makes sense in cases where you have a lot of training data also note that theoretically the gradients of multiple examples in that large setting can average out meaning the large batch size will have only a very small and indistinct gradient having fewer samples in a minibatch will reduce this chance although it increases the risk of going the wrong direction ie having a gradient that points in the opposite directin sgd is a good starting point but there exist several optimizations one of these smarter variants is the suggested adam method there is a highly cited paper about it which can give you a vague idea of what happens under the hood essentially sgd is a very naive solution that does not have any special assumptions or builtin optimizations from what i know adam for example uses firstorder derivatives there exist many different ones and there is a ton of theoretical articles and practical comparisons of the different implementations it is worth a lot to at least understand partially what the parameters do and know what values make sense to set them to for example you already set the learning rate to a sensible value personally i usually end up with values between and maybe use learning rate decay over time if i have larger learning rates

49466894,how to correctly give inputs to embedding lstm and linear layers in pytorch,lstm pytorch,your understanding of most of the concepts is accurate but there are some missing points here and there interfacing embedding to lstm or any other recurrent unit you have embedding output in the shape of batchsize seqlen embeddingsize now there are various ways through which you can pass this to the lstm you can pass this directly to the lstm if lstm accepts input as batchfirst so while creating your lstm pass argument batchfirsttrue or you can pass input in the shape of seqlen batchsize embeddingsize so to convert your embedding output to this shape youll need to transpose the first and second dimensions using torchtransposetensorname like you mentioned q i see many examples online which do something like x embedsviewlensentence selfbatchsize which confuses me a this is wrong it will mix up batches and you will be trying to learn a hopeless learning task wherever you see this you can tell the author to change this statement and use transpose instead there is an argument in favor of not using batchfirst which states that the underlying api provided by nvidia cuda runs considerably faster using batch as secondary using context size you are directly feeding the embedding output to lstm this will fix the input size of lstm to context size of this means that if your input is words to lstm you will be giving it one word at a time always but this is not what we want all the time so you need to expand the context size this can be done as follows unfold documentation now you can proceed as mentioned above to feed this to the lstm just remembed that seqlen is now changed to seqlen contextsize and embeddingsize which is the input size of the lstm is now changed to contextsize embeddingsize using variable sequence lengths input size of different instances in a batch will not be the same always for example some of your sentence might be words long and some might be and some might be so you definitely want variable length sequence input to your recurrent unit to do this there are some additional steps that needs to be performed before you can feed your input to the network you can follow these steps sort your batch from largest sequence to the smallest create a seqlengths array that defines the length of each sequence in the batch this can be a simple python list pad all the sequences to be of equal length to the largest sequence create longtensor variable of this batch now after passing the above variable through embedding and creating the proper context size input youll need to pack your sequence as follows understanding output of lstm now once you have prepared your lstminput acc to your needs you can call lstm as here ht hc needs to be provided as the initial hidden state and it will output the final hidden state you can see why packing variable length sequence is required otherwise lstm will run the over the nonrequired padded words as well now lstmouts will be a packed sequence which is the output of lstm at every step and ht hc are the final outputs and the final cell state respectively ht and hc will be of shape batchsize lstmsize you can use these directly for further input but if you want to use the intermediate outputs as well youll need to unpack the lstmouts first as below now your lstmouts will be of shape maxseqlen contextsize batchsize lstmsize now you can extract the intermediate outputs of lstm according to your need remember that the unpacked output will have s after the size of each batch which is just padding to match the length of the largest sequence which is always the first one as we sorted the input from largest to the smallest also note that ht will always be equal to the last element for each batch output interfacing lstm to linear now if you want to use just the output of the lstm you can directly feed ht to your linear layer and it will work but if you want to use intermediate outputs as well then youll need to figure out how are you going to input this to the linear layer through some attention network or some pooling you do not want to input the complete sequence to the linear layer as different sequences will be of different lengths and you cant fix the input size of the linear layer and yes youll need to transpose the output of lstm to be further used again you cannot use view here ending note i have purposefully left some points such as using bidirectional recurrent cells using step size in unfold and interfacing attention as they can get quite cumbersome and will be out of the scope of this answer
49458902,does applying a dropout layer after the embedding layer have the same effect as applying the dropout through the lstm dropout parameter,python tensorflow machinelearning keras lstm,when you add a dropout layer youre adding dropout to the output of the previous layer only in your case you are adding dropout to your embedding layer an lstm cell is more complex than a single layer neural network when you specify the dropout in the lstm cell you are actually applying dropout to different sub neural network operations in the lstm cell below is a visualization of an lsmt cell from colahs blog on lstms the best visualization of lstmrnns out there the yellow boxes represent fully connected network operations each with their own weights which occur under the hood of the lstm this is neatly wrapped up in the lstm cell wrapper though its not really so hard to code by hand when you specify dropout in the lstm cell what you are doing under the hood is applying dropout to each of these neural network operations this is effectively adding modeladddropout times once after each of the yellow blocks you see in the diagram within the internals of the lstm cell i hope that short discussion makes it more clear how the dropout applied in the lstm wrapper which is applied to effectively sub networks within the lstm is different from the dropout you applied once in the sequence after your embedding layer and to answer your question directly yes these two dropout definitions are very much different notice as a further example to help elucidate the point if you were to define a simple layer fully connected neural network you would need to define dropout after each layer not once modeladddropout is not some kind of global setting its adding the dropout operation to a pipeline of operations if you have layers you need to add dropout operations

43313548,keras how to shape d data time feature vector into d,python keras lstm,what is the difference between the timestep and length of training data am i missing something else timestep is number of rnnlstm cells in model and that depends on your sequence length first to use lstm you need to convert your training data in d format suppose you are working on some time series problem and for prediction of each instant in training data you considers previousadjacent training instants are important in such case your each training instant will be of shape num of feature in each training sample in this case so i guess you need little modification to create new training data in which each instant is sequence matrix of required training samples the shape of your training data will be number of training samples seqlength numfeatures change input shape in lstm cell to sequencelength numfeatures ie this is just my limitted understanding of concept hope this works

42253934,keras how to use the learned embedding layer for input and output,python tensorflow deeplearning keras lstm,in training phase you can use two inputs one for target one for input theres an offset of between these two sequences and reuse the embedding layer if you input sentence is you can generate two sequence from it in out then you can use keras functional api to reuse embedding layer note its not keras code just pseudo code in testing phase typically youll need to write your own decode function firstly you choose a word or a few words to start from then feed this word or short word sequence to network to predict next words embedding at this step you can define your own sample function say you may want to choose the word whose embedding is nearest to the predicted one as the next word or you may want to sample the next word from a distribution in which words with nearer embeddings to the predicted embedding has a larger probability to be chosen once you choose the next word then feed it to network and predict the next one and so forth so you need to generate one word put it another way one embedding at a time rather than input a whole sequence to the network if the above statements are too abstract for you heres an good example line is the introduction part which randomly choose a small piece of texts from corpus to work on from line on theres a loop in which each step samples a character this is a charrnn so each timestep inputs a char for your case it should be a word not a char l predicts next chars distribution l samples from the distribution hope this is clear enough

77456745,negative values in data passed to multinomialnb when vectorize using wordvec,python scikitlearn gensim wordvec naivebayes,the error each wordvec embedding for a word is a vector whose elements can take any real number value this means that even after you take the mean of all vectors there might be some negative values in the final vector this is not a problem however since you are using multinomial naive bayes mnb it is causing problems why mnb assumes that the data follows a multinomial distribution a generalization of the binomial distribution it is based entirely on the idea of counts of successes s and failures s thus you can imagine why scikitlearn complains about mnb getting negative values the solution if you want to keep the model as mnb you will have to do away with the negative values some ideas as per this link removefilter all negative values from the final vector normalize the vector to range using minmaxscaler you can also change the vectorization method from wordvec to countvectorizer tfidfvectorizer tfidf will work even though it gives fractional values in the final vector mnb is not designed to work with fractions only integers but it works in practice if you are okay with using another model you can try some model options below gaussian naive bayes support vector machines decision trees code example using minmaxscaler just switch the line clf multinomialnb to the following from sklearnpreprocessing import minmaxscaler from sklearnpipeline import pipeline clf pipeline scaler minmaxscaler clf multinomialnb transformers depending upon your task you might also want to check out transformers they have their own vectorization method generating dense semantic embeddings instead of working at a purely syntactic level as wordvec does these models are much bigger and computationally expensive but will produce much better results if machine learning models fail to satisfy with accuracy further readings a comprehensive scikitlearn guide transformers feel free to ask any questions
76773386,infer document vectors for pretrained word vectors,python gensim wordvec docvec,the docvec algoithm called paragraph vector in the papers that introduced it is not initialized from external pretrained wordvectors nor is creating wordvectors a distinct st step of creating a docvec model from scratch that could somehow be done separately or cachedreused across runs so not even the internal inference routines can do anything with just some external wordvectors they depend on model weights separate from wordvectors learned from doctoword relations seen in training ive occasionally seen some variantsimprovisedchanges that move a bit in the direction of taking outside wordvectors but ive not seen evidence such variations outperform the usual approach and theyre not implemented in gensim in standard dovvec rather that taking wordvectors as an input if the chosen mode of docvec creates typical perword wordvectors at all they get cotrained simultaneously with the docvectors in the plain pvdbow mode dm no typical wordvectors are trained at all only docvectors the support for inferencing new docvectors this mode is thus pretty fast and often works quite well for broad topical similarity for short docs of dozens to hundreds of words because the only thing training is trying to do is predict indoc words from candidate docvectors in this mode the window parameter is meaningless every word in a doc affects its docvector you can optionally add to that pvdbow mode interleaved skipgram wordvector training by using the nondefault dbowwords parameter this cotraining using a shared output center word prediction layer forces the wordvectors docvectors into a shared coordinate system so that theyre directly comparable to each other the window parameter then affects the skipgram wordtoword training just like in wordvec skipgram training training takes longer by a factor of about the window value and in fact the model is spending more total computation making the words predict their neighbors than the docvector predicting the doc words so theres a margin at which improving the wordvectors may be crowding out improvement of the docvectors the pvdm mode the default dm parameter inherently uses a combo of condidate docvector neighbor words to predict each center word that makes window relevant and inherently puts the wordvectors docvectors into a shared comparable coordinate space without as much overhead for larger window values as the interleaved skipgram above there may still be some reduction in docvector expressiveness to accomodate all the wordtoword influences which is best for a particular set of docs subject domain and intended downstream use is really a matter for experimentation as youve mentioned comparing docvectors to wordvectors is an aim only the latter two modes above pvdbow with optional skipgram or pvdm would be appropriate but if you dont absolutely need that have time to run more comparisons id still recommend trying plain pvdbow for its speed strength in some needs lets assume your sentences are an average of tokens each so your k docs k tokens tokenssentence give you million sentences yes holding say dimensional docvectors bytes each intraining for million texts has prohibitive ram costs gb as youve noted you could use a model trained for only the k docs to then infer docvectors for other smaller texts liek the sentences you shouldnt worry about those wasted k docvectors they were necessary to create the inferencing capability you could throw them away after training inference will still work and maybe you will have some reason to compare words or sentences or new docs or other docfragments to those fulldoc vectors you could also consider training on chunks larger than sentences but smaller than your full docs like paragraphs or sections if you can segment docs that way you could conceivably even use arbitrary ntoken chunks and it might work well only way to know is to try this sort of algorithm isnt supersensitive to small changes in tokenizationtextsegmenting as its the bulk of the data and broad relationships its modeling you can also simultaneously train docvectors for different levels of text by supplying more than one tag key for looking up the docvector posttraining per example text that is if your full document with id d has distinct sections ds ds ds you could feed it the doc as texts the st section with tags d ds the nd with tags d ds the rd with tags d ds then all the texts contribute to the traintuning of the d docvector but the subsections only affect the respective subsectionvectors whether thatd be appropriate depends on your goals the effect of supplying multiple tags varies a bit between modes but it may also be worth some experiments

69603325,wordvec for network embedding ignores words nodes in corpus walks,python machinelearning graph gensim wordvec,are you sure your walks corpus is what you expect and what gensim wordvec expects for example is lenwalks equal to is lenwalks equal to is walks a list of stringtokens note also by default wordvec uses a mincount so any token that appears fewer than times is ignored during training in most cases this minimum or an even higher one makes sense because tokens with only or a few usage examples in usual naturallanguage training data cant get good wordvectors but can in aggregate function as dilutive noise that worsens other vectors depending on your graph one walk from each node might not ensure that node appears at least times in all the walks so you could try mincount but itd probably be better to do walks from every starting point or enough walks to ensure all nodes appear at least times is still only training words with a manageable count vocabulary if theres an issue expanding the whole training set as one list you could make an iterable that generates the walks as needed one by one rather than all upfront alternatively something like walks per startingnode but of only steps each would keep the corpus about the same size bu guarantee each node appears at least times or even adaptively keep adding walks until youre sure every node is represented enough times for example pick a random node do a walk keep a running tally of each nodes appearances so far keep growing the net total of every nodes you could also try an adaptive corpus that keeps adding walks until every node is represented a minimum number of times conceivably for some remote nodes that might take quite long to happen upon them so another refinement might be do some initial walk or walks then tally how many visits each node got while the leastfrequent node is below the target mincount start another walk from it guaranteeing it at least one more visit this could help oversample lessconnected regions which might be good or bad notably with natural language text the wordvec sample parameter is quite helpful to discard certain overrepresented words preventing them from monopolizing training time redundantly ensuring lessfrequent words also get good representations its a parameter which can sometimes provide the doublewhammy of less training time and better results ensuring your walks spend more time in lessconnected areas might provide a similar advantage especially if your downstream use for the vectors is just as interested in the vectors for the lessvisited regions

64817706,how can i optimize my embedding transformation on a huge dataset,python pythonx numpy gensim fasttext,note that this sort of summaryvector for a text the average or sum of all its wordvectors is fairly crude it can work ok as a baseline in some contexts such fuzzy inforetrieval among short texts or as a classifier input in some cases if the keyerror is hit often that exceptionhandling can be expensive and it may make sense to instead check for whether a key is in the collection but also you may not want to be using an originvector all zeros for any missing word it likely offers no benefit over just skipping those words so you might get some speedup by changing your code to ignore missing words rather than adding an allzeros vector in an exception handlers but also if youre truly using a fasttext model rather than say wordvec it will never keyerror for an unknown word because it will always synthesize a vector out of the character ngrams word fragments it learned during training you should probably just drop your getvect function entirely relying just on normal access further gensims keyedvector models already support returning multiple results when indexed by a list of multiple keys and the numpy npsum might work a slight bit faster on these arrays than the purepython sum so you might get a small speedup if you replace your sumvectors with def sumvectorsphrase model return npsummodelwvphrase axis to optimize further you might need to profile the code in a heavyusage loop or even reconsider whether this is the form of textvectorization you want to pursue though better methods typically require more calculation than this simple sumaverage
63779875,sentences embedding using wordvec,python gensim wordvec embedding,note that wordvec is not inherently a method for modeling sentences only words so theres no single official way to use wordvec to represent sentences once quick crude approach is to create a vector for a sentence or other multiword text by averaging all the wordvectors together its fast its betterthannothing and does ok on some simple broadlytopical tasks but isnt going to capture the full meaning of a text very well especially any meaning which is dependent on grammar polysemy or sophisticated contextual hints still you could use it to get a fixedsize vector per short text and calculate pairwise similaritiesdistances between those vectors and feed the results into dimensionalityreduction algorithms for visualization or other purposes other algorithms actually create vectors for longer texts a shallow algorithm very closely related to wordvec is paragraph vectors available in gensim as the docvec class but its still not very sophisticated and still not grammaraware a number of deepernetwork text models like bert elmo others may be possibilities wordvec related algorithms are very datahungry all of their beneficial qualities arise from the tugofwar between many varied usage examples for the same word so if you have a toysized dataset you wont get a set of vectors with useful interrelationships but also rare words in your larger dataset wont get good vectors it is typical in training to discard as if they werent even there words that appear below some mincount frequency because not only would their vectors be poor from just one or a few idiosyncratic sample uses but because there are many such underrepresented words in total keeping them around tends to make other wordvectors worse too theyre noise so your proposed idea of taking individual instances of travel replacing them with singleappearance tokens is note very likely to give interesting results lowering your mincount to will get you vectors for each variant but theyll be of far worse morerandom quality than your other wordvectors having receiving comparatively little training attention compared to other words and each being fully influenced by just their few surrounding words rather than the entire range of all surrounding contexts that could all help contribute to the useful positioning of a unified travel token you might be able to offset these problems a little by retaining the original version of the sentence so you still get a travel vector repeating your tokenmangled sentences several times shuffling them to appear throughout the corpus to somewhat simulate more real occurrences of your synthetic contexts but without real variety most of the problems of such singlecontext vectors will remain another possible way to compare travelsenta travelsentb etc would be to ignore the exact vector for travel or travelsentx entirely but instead compile a summary vector for the words surrounding n words for example if you have examples of the word travel create vectors that are each of the n words around travel these vectors might show some vague clustersneighborhoods especially in the case of a word with verydifferent alternate meanings some research adapting wordvec to account for polysemy uses this sort of context vector approach to influencechoose among alternate wordsenses you might also find this research on modeling words as drawing from alternate atoms of discourse interesting linear algebraic structure of word meanings to the extent you have short headlinelike texts and only wordvectors without the data or algorithms to do deeper modeling you may also want to look into the word movers distance calculation for comparing texts rather than reducing a single text to a single vector it models it as a bag of wordvectors then it defines a distance as a costtotransform one bag to another bag more similar words are easier to transform into each other than lesssimilar words so expressions that are very similar with just a few synonyms replaced report as quite close it can be quite expensive to calculate on longer texts but may work well for short phrases and small sets of headlinestweetsetc its available on the gensim keyedvector classes as wmdistance an example of the kinds of correlations it may be useful in discovering is in this article navigating themes in restaurant reviews with word movers distance

61062237,gensim train wordvec and fasttext,python machinelearning gensim,its perfectly acceptable to supply your training corpus allwords when you instantiate the model object in that case the model will automatically perform all steps needed to train the model using that data so you can do this model wordvecallwords where is your nondefault params its also acceptable to not provide the corpus when instantiating the model but then the model is extremely minimal with just your initial parameters it still needs to discover the relevant vocabulary which requires a single pass over the training data then allocate some varylarge internal structures to accommodate those words then do the actual training which requires multiple additional passes over the training data so if you dont provide the corpus when the model is instantiated you should do two extra method calls model wordvec where is your nondefault params modelbuildvocaballwords discover vocabulary allocate model now train with ofpasses oftexts set by earlier steps modeltrainallwords epochsmodeliter totalexamplesmodelcorpuscount these two code blocks ive shown are equivalent the top does the usual steps for you the bottom breaks the steps out into your explicit control the code youd excerpted in your question showing only a train call would error for a number of reasons the buildvocab is a necessary step to have a fullyallocated model and the call to train must explicitly state the desired epochs and an accurate count totalexamples of the numberofitems in the corpus but you can and typically should reuse values that were already cached into the model by the two previous steps its your choice which approach to use generally people only use the separatesteps process if they want to do other outputlogging between the steps or something advanced between the steps that might tamper with the model state

59482140,gensim docvec infervector on unseen words differs based on characters in these words,gensim wordvec docvec,unseen words are ignored for the actual process of iterative inference tuning a vector to betterpredict a texts words according to a frozen docvec model however inference starts with a pseudorandomlyinitialized vector and the full set of tokens passedin including unknown words are used as the seed for that randominitialization this seeded initialization is done as a potential small aid to those seeking fullyreproducible inference but in practice seeking such exactreproduction rather than just runtorun similarity is usually a bad idea see the gensim faqs q q about varying results from runtorun for more details so what youre seeing is your different tokenized texts each cause a pseudorandom but deterministic with respect to the source text vector initialization since no words are known inference afterwards is a noop there are no words to predict the pseudorandom initialized vector is returned the infervector method should probably log a warning or return a flag value like perhaps the origin vector as a better hint that nothing meaningful is actually happening but you may wish to check any text before you supply it to infervector if none of its words are in the dvmodelwv then inference will simply be returning a small random initialization vector
59478986,how to perform docvecinfervector on millions of documents,gensim docvec,currently theres no gensim api which does large batches of inference at once which could help by using multiple threads it is a wishlist item among other improvements you might get some speedup up to the number of cores in your cpu by spreading your own inference jobs over multiple threads to eliminate all multithreaded contention due to the python gil you could spread your inference over separate python processes if each process loads the model using some of the tricks described at another answern see below the os will help them share the large model backing arrays only paying the cost in ram once while they each could completely independently due one unblocking thread of inference specifically docvecload can also use the mmapr mode to load an existing ondisk model with memorymapping of the backing files inference alone with no mostsimilarlike operations will only read the shared raw backing arrays so no fussing with the norm variants should be necessary if youre launching singlepurpose processes that just do inference then save their results and exit

54521323,i get more vectors than my documents size gensim docvec,python tags gensim docvec,the number of tags a docvec model will learn is equal to the number of unique tags youve provided you provided different rid values and different rlabel values hence a total number of tags larger than just your document count i suspect your rid values are plain integers but start at if you use plain integers rather than strings as tags then docvec will use those ints as the indexes into its internal vectorarray directly and thus int indexes that are less than the numbers you use like will also be allocated hence your count of total known tags because it also allocated space for tag so that explains your tag count and theres nothing necessarily wrong beware however your dataset is very small most published work uses softhousands to millions of documents you can sometimes still eke out useful vectors by using smaller vectors or more training epochs but mainly docvec and similar algorithms need more data to work best still a vector size is quite tiny with small data especially the simple pvdbow mode dm is often a fasttraining topperformer but note it doesnt train wordvectors using context windows unless you add dbowwords option which then again slows it down with that extra wordvector training whether you should be using the labels as documenttags at all is not certain the classic use of docvec just gives each doc a unique id then lets downstream steps learn the relations to other things mixing in known other documentlevel labels can sometimes help or hurt depending on your data and ultimate goals more tags can to an extent dilute whatever is learned over a larger model at least in natural language retaining words that only appear once or a few times can often be harmful to overall vectorquality theres too few occurrences to model them well and since there will by zipfs law be many such words they can wind up interfering a lot wit the training of other entitites so a default mincount or even higher with larger datasets often helps overall quality and you shouldnt assume that simply retaining more data with mincount necessarily helps
54492390,what are the defaults for gensims fasttext,gensim fasttext,the very link in your question shows all the defaults right there to excerpt it here those that are for the corresponding parameter to the facebook native fasttext probably should have the same defaults but its possible that some have varied slightly to match analogous parameters in other gensim classses so if you were counting on identical defaults for some analysis you should check these values against the facebook docs

54243797,combiningadding vectors from different wordvec models,python gensim wordvec trainingdata corpus,generally only word vectors that were trained together are meaningfully comparable its the interleaved tugofwar during training that moves them to relative orientations that are meaningful and theres enough randomness in the process that even models trained on the same corpus will vary in where they place individual words using words from both corpuses as guideposts it is possible to learn a transformation from one space a to the other b that tries to move those knownsharedwords to their corresponding positions in the other space then applying that same transformation to the words in a that arent in b you can find b coordinates for those words making them comparable to other nativeb words this technique has been used with some success in wordvecdriven language translation where the guidepost pairs are known translations or as a means of growing a limited wordvector set with wordvectors from elsewhere whether itd work well enough for your purposes i dont know i imagine it could go astray especially where the two training corpuses use shared tokens in wildly different senses theres a class translationmatrix that may be able to do this for you in the gensim library see theres a demo notebook of its use at whenever practical doing a full training on a mixedtogether corpus with all word examples is likely to do better
54213078,streaming corpus to a vectorizer in a pipeline,scikitlearn streaming gensim corpus,with just documents unless theyre gigantic its not necessarily the loadingofdata into memory thats causing you problems note especially loading tokenizing the docs has already succeeded before you even begin the scikitlearn pipelinesgridsearch and the further multiplication of memory usage is in the necessarilyrepeated alternate models not the original docs scikitlearn apis tend to assume the training data is fully in memory so even though the innermost gensim classes docvec are happy with streamed data of arbitrary size its harder to adapt that into scikitlearn so you should look elsewhere and there are other issues with your shown code ive often had memory or lockup issues with scikitlearns attempts at parallelism as enabled through njobslike parameters especially inside jupyter notebooks it forks full os processes which tend to blow up memory usage each subprocess gets a full copy of the parent processs memory which might be efficiently shared until the subprocess starts movingchanging things sometimes one process or interprocess communication fails and the main process is just left waiting for a response which seems to especially confuse jupyter notebooks so unless you have tons of memory and absolutely need scikitlearn parallelism id recommend trying to get things working with njobs first and only later experimenting with more jobs in contrast the workers of the docvec class and dvtransformer uses lighterweight threads and you should use at least workers and perhaps if you have at least that many cores rather than the workers youre using now but also youre doing a bunch of redundant actions of unclear value in your code the test set from initial traintest split isnt ever used perhaps you were thinking of keeping it aside as a final validation set thats the most rigorous way to get a good estimate of your final results performance on future unseen data but in many contexts data is limited and that estimate isnt as important as just doing the best possible with limited data the gridsearchcv itself does a way traintest split as part of its work and its best results are remembered in its properties when its done so you dont need to do the crossvalscore again you can read the results from gridsearchcv
54186233,docvec infer most similar vector from concatenateddocvecs,python gensim wordvec docvec,the concatenateddocvecs is a simple utility wrapper class that lets you access the concatenation of a tags vectors in multiple underlying docvec models it exists to make it a little easier to reproduce some of the analysis in the original paragraphvector paper it doesnt reproduce all the functionality of a docvec model or set of keyedvectors so cant directly hep you with the mostsimilar you want to perform you could instead do a mostsimilar operation within each of the constituent models then combine the two similarity measures per neighbor such as by averaging them to get a usable similaritylike value for the combined model and then resort on that i suspect but am not sure such a value from the two d models would behave very much like a a true cosinesimilarity from the concatenated d model alternatively instead of using concatenateddocvec wrapper class which only creates and returns the concatenated d vectors when requested you could look at the various keyedvectors class in gensim and use or adapt one to be filled with all the concatenated d vectors from the two constituent models then its mostsimilar would work

53791972,similarity measure using vectors in gensim,gensim wordvec,you should look at the source code for the gensim mostsimilar method which is used to propose answers to such analogy questions specifically when you try the top result will in a sufficientlytrained model often be queen or similar so you can look at the source code to see exactly how it calculates the target combination of wvking wvman wvwoman before searching all known vectors for those closest vectors to that target see and note that the local variable mean is the combination of the positive and negative values provided you might also find other methods there useful either directly or as models for your own code such as distances or nsimilarity
53417171,fixedsize topics vector in gensim lda topic modelling for finding similar texts,python gensim lda topicmodeling cosinesimilarity,i have used gensim for topic modeling before and i had not faced this issue ideally if you pass numtopics then it returns top topics with the highest probability for each document and then you should be able to generate the cosine similarity matrix by doing something like this but for some reason if you are getting unequal number of topics you can assume a zero probability value for the remaining topics and include them in your vector when you calculate similarity ps if you could provide a sample of your input documents it would be easier to reproduce your output and look into it
52488877,finding the distance between doctag and infervector with gensim docvec,python gensim docvec,doctag is the internal name for the keys to docvectors the result of an infervector operation is a vector so as youve literally asked these arent comparable you could ask a model for a known docvector by its doctag key that was supplied during training via modeldocvecsdoctag that would be comparable to the result of an infervector call with two vectors in hand you can use scipy routines to calculate various kinds of distance for example you can also look at how gensims docveckeyedvectors does similaritydistance between vectors that are known by their doctag key names inside a model in its similarity and distance functions at

47300490,how to obtain document vectors in docvec in gensim,python gensim docvec,theres no patternretrieval but you can access the list of all known string doctags in modeldocvecsoffsetdoctag you could then loop over that list to find all matches and retrieve each individually also all the docvectors are in a large array modeldocvecsdoctagsyn and if youve used exclusively string doctags then the position of a tag in offsetdoctag will be exactly the index of the corresponding vector in doctagsyn that would allow you to use numpy mask indexing to grab a subset of vectors as a new array like of course this arrayofvectors no longer has the recipes in the same positions as the original so youd need extra steps to know where for example the recipe vector is in recipesvectors

46762366,gensim keyedvectors object word count,gensim,the singlefile format loaded by loadwordvecformat doesnt include word counts so they cant appear in the loaded object the usual convention is to put such files in mostfrequent to leastfrequent order though so in the absence of true count information a plug value is used that decreases from the vocabularysize to thats the number thats somewhat like the word index youre seeing theres a way in some software to save extra info in a separate file see the fvocab option of gensims savewordvecformat and loadwordvecformat so perhaps thats already available with your vectors and you can use that option
46647945,how to manually change the vector dimensions of a word in gensim wordvec,python vector gensim wordvec vectorspace,since wordvec vectors are typically only created by the iterative training process then accessed the gensim wordvec object does not support direct assignment of new values by its word indexes however as it is in python all its internal structures are fully viewabletamperable by you and as it is opensource you can view exactly how it does all of its existing functionality and use that as a model for how to do new things specifically the raw wordvectors are in recent versions of gensim stored in a property of the wordvec object called wv and this wv property is an instance of keyedvectors if you examine its source code you can see accesses of wordvectors by string key eg boy including those by indexing implemented by the getitem method go through its method wordvec you can view the source of that method either in your local installation or at github there youll see the word is actually converted to an integerindex via selfvocabwordindex then used to access an internal syn or synnorm array depending on whether the user is accessing the raw or unitnormalized vector if you look elsewhere where these are set up or simply examine them in your own consolecode as if by wordvectorswvsyn youll see these are numpy arrays which do support direct assignment by index so you can directly tamper with their values by integer index as if by and then future accesses of wordvectorswvboy will return your updated values notes if you want synnorm to be updated to have the proper unitnormed vectors as are used in mostsimilar and other operations itd likely be best to modify syn first then discard and recalculate synnorm via adding new words would require more involved objecttampering because it will require growing the syn replacing it with a larger array and updating the vocab dict

46297740,how to turn embeddings loaded in a pandas dataframe into a gensim model,python pandas gensim,not sure what the preferred way of doing this is but the format gensim expects is pretty easy to replicate the header is space separated integers the number of words in the vocabulary and the length of the word vector the first column of each row is the word itself the rest of the columns are the elements of the word vector the fmt weirdness is to have the first element formatted as a string and the rest formatted as a float then can load this in gensim and do whatever
45458493,gensim word vectors encoding problems,python gensim,if you save vectors using gensims native save method you should load them with the native load method if you want to load vectors using loadwordvecformat youll need to save them with savewordvecformat youll lose some information this way such as the exact occurrence counts that would otherwise be inside the keyedvectorsvocab dictionary items
45069715,after loading a pretrained wordvec model how do i get wordvec representations of new sentences,clusteranalysis gensim wordvec,wordvec only offers vector representations for words not sentences one crude but somewhat effective for some purposes way to go from wordvectors to vectors for longer texts like sentences is to average all the wordvectors together this isnt a function of the gensim wordvec class you have to code this yourself for example with the wordvectors already loaded as wordmodel youd roughly do real code might add handling for when the tokens arent all known to the model or other ways of tokenizingfiltering the text and so forth there are other more sophisticated ways to get the vector for a lengthoftext such as the paragraph vectors algorithm implemented by gensims docvec class these dont necessarily start with pretrained wordvectors but can be trained on your own corpus of texts

44553278,how do i use the word vector returned by wordvec as features,python scikitlearn neuralnetwork gensim wordvec,your wv vector captures some semantic similarity with respect to the word this vector must be considered a whole it is a feature in itself one nice attribute of neural networks are their capability of extracting and learning patterns on their own as input you could consider concatenating the word vector along with a vectorisednumerical equivalent of the pos tag and finally the singularity state as long as you follow a consistent scheme with the training testing and unseen data your mlp will use the entire input to automatically extract features from the input as it learns
44345576,why are almost all cosine similarities positive between word or document vectors in gensim docvec,python gensim wordvec docvec,theres no inherent guarantee in wordvecdocvec that the generated set of vectors is symmetrically distributed around the origin point they could be disproportionately in some directions which would yield the results youve seen in a few tests i just did on the toysized dataset lee corpus used in the bundled gensim docsnotebooksdocvecleeipynb notebook checking the cosinesimilarities of all documents against the first document it vaguely seems that using hierarchicalsoftmax rather than negative sampling hs negative yields a balance between and using a smaller number of negative samples such as negative yields a more balanced set of results using a larger number such as negative yields relatively more cosinesimilarities while not conclusive this is mildly suggestive that the arrangement of vectors may be influenced by the negative parameter specifically typical negativesampling parameters such as the default negative mean words will be trained more times as nontargets than as positive targets that might push the preponderance of final coordinates in one direction more testing on larger datasets and modes and more analysis of how the model setup could affect final vector positions would be necessary to have more confidence in this idea if for some reason you wanted a more balanced arrangement of vectors you could consider transforming their positions posttraining theres an interesting recent paper in the wordvec space allbutthetop simple and effective postprocessing for word representations that found sets of trained wordvectors dont necessarily have a magnitude mean theyre on average in one direction from the origin and further this paper reports that subtracting the common mean to recenter the set and also removing a few other dominant directions can improve the vectors usefulness for certain tasks intuitively i suspect this allbutthetop transformation might serve to increase the discriminative contrast in the resulting vectors a similar process might yield similar benefits for docvectors and would likely make the full set of cosinesimilarities to any docvector more balanced between and
44233296,problems accessing docvectors with gensim,gensim docvec,the gensim docvec class uses exactly the document tags youve passed it during training as keys to the docvectors and yes that labeledlinesentence class is adding n to the documenttags specifically those appear to be the linenumbers from the associated files so youll have to request vectors using those same keys that were provided during training with the n if what you really want is a vectorperline if you instead want each file to be its own document youll need to change the corpus class to use the whole file as a document looking at the tutorial you reference it appears they have a second labeledlinesentence class that isnt lineoriented but still is named that way but youre not using that variant separately you dont need to loop and call train multiple times and manually adjust the alpha thats almost certainly not doing what you intend in any recent version of gensim where train already iterates over the corpus multiple times in the most recent versions of gensim there will even be an error if you call it that way since many outdated examples on the web encourage this mistake just call train once it will iterate over your corpus the number of times specified when the model was constructed thats a default of but controllable with the iter initialization parameter and or more is common with docvec corpuses
44163836,how does docvecinfervector combine across words,python gensim docvec,infervector doesnt combine the vectors for your given tokens and in some modes doesnt consider those tokens vectors at all rather it considers the entire docvec model as being frozen against internal changes and then assumes the tokens youve provided are an example text with a previously untrained tag lets call this implied but unnamed tag x using a traininglike process it tries to find a good vector for x that is it starts with a random vector as it did for all tags in original training then sees how well that vector as modelinput predicts the texts words by checking the model neuralnetworks predictions for input x then via incremental gradient descent it makes that candidate vector for x better and better at predicting the texts words after enough such inferencetraining the vector will be about as good given the rest of the frozen model as it possibly can be at predicting the texts words so even though youre providing that text as an input to the method inside the model what youve provided is used to pick target outputs of the algorithm for optimization note that tiny examples like one or a few words arent likely to give very meaningful results they are sharpedged corner cases and the essential value of these sorts of dense embedded representations usually arises from the marginal balancing of many wordinfluences it will probably help to do far more traininginference cycles than the infervector default steps some have reported tens or hundreds of steps work best for them and it may be especially valuable to use more steps with short texts it may also help to use a starting alpha for inference more like that used in bulk training alpha rather than the infervector default alpha
44143441,code for gensim wordvec as an http service keyedvectors attribute error,python gensim wordvec,fyi that demo code was baed on gensim from as listed in its requirementstxt and would need updating to work with the latest gensim it might be sufficient to add a line to wvserverpy at line just after the loadwordvecformat to force the creation of the needed synnorm property which in older gensims was autocreated on load before deleting the raw syn values specifically you would leave out the replacetrue if you were going to be doing operations other than mostsimilar that might require raw vectors if this works to fix the problem for you a pullrequest to the wvservergooglenews repo would be favorably received
43881924,inconsistent similarity betwen inferred and trained vectors in docvec,python gensim docvec,the paragraph vector that was stored inside the model mdocvecs was created during the training phase and then the model might have changed as other paragraphs were used for training with infervector you are using final state of the model you could try to minimize this difference by adding more epochs to the training phase however i would recommend you to always use the infervector so you can be sure that all your paragraphs vectors were created with the same version of model
43543762,does docvec learn representations for the tags,gensim docvec,for gensims docvec your text examples must be objects similar to the example taggeddocument class with words and tags properties the tags property should be a list of tags which serve as keys to the docvectors that will be learned from the corresponding text in the classicoriginal case each document has a single tag essentially a unique id for that one document tags can be strings but for very large corpuses docvec will use somewhat less memory if you instead use tags that are plain python ints starting from with no skipped values the tags are used to lookup the learned vectors after training if you had a document during training with the single tag mars youd lookup the learned vector with if you were do a modeldocvecsmostsimilarmars call the results will be reported by their tag keys as well the tags are just keys into the docvectors collection they have no semantic meaning and even if a string is repeated from the wordtokens in the text theres no necessary relation between this tag key and the word that is if you have a document whose single id tag is mars theres no essential relationship between the learned docvector accessed via that key modeldocvecsmars and any learned wordvector accessed with the same string key modelwvmars theyre coming from separate collectionsofvectors

33828304,k means clustering on n dimensional vectors,python scikitlearn kmeans gensim,so after looking at the source code it looks like gensim manually creates a sparse vector for each document which is just a list of tuples this makes the error make sense since scikitlearns kmeans algorithm allows for sparse scipy matrices but it doesnt know how to interpret the gensim sparse vector you can turn each of these individual lists into a scipy csrmatrix with the following it would be better to convert all docs at once but this is a quick fix you should be able to make use of this sparsevec but if it throws errors you can turn it into a dense numpy array with toarray or numpy matrix with todense edit turns out that gensim provides some nifty utility functions including one that takes the streamed corpus object format and returns a csc matrix heres a full example of how your code might work connected to sklearns kmeans clustering algorithm you should calculate and pass the additional parameters that go into corpuscsc as it could save you cycles depending on the size of your corpus we transpose the matrix as gensim puts the documents in the columns and the terms in the rows you can turn the scipy sparse matrix into the myriad of other types depending on your use case besides just the kmeans clustering

73113261,the essence of learnable positional embedding does embedding improve outcomes better,deeplearning pytorch bertlanguagemodel transformermodel,what is the purpose of positional embeddings in transformers bert included the only interaction between the different tokens is done via selfattention layers if you look closely at the mathematical operation implemented by these layers you will notice that these layers are permutation equivariant that is the representation of i do like coding and do i like coding is the same because the words tokens are the same in both sentences only their order is different as you can see this permutation equivariance is not a desired property in many cases to break this symmetryequivariance one can simply code the actual position of each wordtoken in the sentence for example i do like coding is no longer identical to do i like coding this is the purpose of positional encodingembeddings to make selfattention layers sensitive to the order of the tokens now to your questions learnable position encoding is indeed implemented with a simple single nnparameter the position encoding is just a code added to each token marking its position in the sequence therefore all it requires is a tensor of the same size as the input sequence with different values per position is it enough to introduce position encoding once in a transformer architecture yes since transformers stack multiple selfattention layers it is enough to add positional embeddings once at the beginning of the processing the position information is fused into the semantic representation learned per token a nice visualization of this effect in vision transformers vit can be found in this work shir amir yossi gandelsman shai bagon and tali dekel deep vit features as dense visual descriptors arxiv in sec and fig they show how the position information dominates the representation of tokens at early layers but as you go deeper in a transformer semantic information takes over

71625755,embedding layer torchnnembedding in pytorch,python deeplearning neuralnetwork pytorch,in short the embedding layer has learnable parameters and the usefulness of the layer depends on what inductive bias you want on the data does embedding layer has trainable variables that learn over time as to improve in embedding yes as stated in the docs under the variables section it has an embedding weight that is altered during the training process may you please provide an intuition on it and what circumstances to use like would the house price regression benefit from it an embedding layer is commonly used in nlp tasks where the input is tokenized this means that the input is discrete in a sense and can be used for indexing the weight which is basically what the embedding layer is in forward mode this discrete attribution implies that inputs like are entirely different until the semantic correlation has been learnt house price regression has continuous input space and values such as and might be more correlated than the values and this kind of assumption about the hypothesis space is called an inductive bias and pretty much every machine learning architecture conforms to some sort of inductive bias i believe it is possible to use embedding layers for regression problems which would require some kind of discretization but it would not benefit from it if so that it learns what is the difference than just using linear layers there is a big difference the linear layer performs matrix multiplication with the weight as opposed to using it as a lookup table during backpropagation for the embedding layer the gradients will only propagate threw the corresponding indices used in the lookup and duplicate indices are accumulated

65976622,can i use embedding layer instead of one hot as category input,machinelearning keras deeplearning prediction,yes you can use embeddings and that approach does work the attribute will not be equal to one element in the embedding but that combination of elements will equal to that attribute the size of the embedding is something that you will have to select yourself a good formula to follow is embeddingsize min m where m is the number of categories so if you have m you will have an embedding size of a higher embedding size means it will capture more details on the relationship between the categorical variables in my experience embeddings do help especially when you have s of categoriesif you have a small number of categories ie sex of a person then onehot encoding is sufficient within a certain category on which is better i find embeddings do perform better in general when there are s of unique values in a category why this is so i do not have any concrete reasons but some intuitions for it for example representing categories as dimensional dense vectorsword embeddings requires classifiers to learn far fewer weights than if the categories were represented as dimensional vectorsonehot encoding and the smaller parameter space possibly helps with generalization and avoiding overfitting
