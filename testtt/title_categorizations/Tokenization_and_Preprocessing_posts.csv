79178041,normalization of token embeddings in bert encoder blocks,nlp normalization bertlanguagemodel attentionmodel,layer normalization is applied to each tokens embedding individually this means each token gets its own normalization based on its specific features this helps to ensure that the model can process each token effectively regardless of the other tokens in the sequence bert differs from the original transformer architecture in the placement of layer normalization in bert its applied before the selfattention mechanism while in the original transformer its applied after this subtle difference can have a significant impact on the models performance see here update please refer to the following paper on layer normalization in the transformer architecture the authors explored both approaches of applying layer normalization before and after attention layernamely preln and postln in bert their results indicate that using layer normalization before the attention layer yields better results for a summarized review of the same paper you can see here overall you might find different bert diagrams in which each used a different approach of using layer normalization

78778988,do i need to use named entity recognition ner in tokenization,python pythonx nlp spacy namedentityrecognition,tokenization typically is the splitting of a sentence into words or even subwords i am not sure what you later plan to do with the data but it is a convention in nlp to stick to either the document level sentence level or wordtoken level having some mix of token and ngram level like apple pay required an iphone to use it in my opinion will not help you in most later use cases if you later train a classifier assuming youre talking about finetuning a transformer based language model on a token classification task would then use something like the iob format to handle ngrams eg like so token label apple b pay i required o an o iphone b to o use o it o o of course this depends on your application and directly merging to ngrams might work well for you if you have some application where you are searching for frequent ngrams you could use collocation metrics to extract those ngrams eg using nltks collocationfinder or as you mentioned use spacy either for noun chunk extraction or named entity recognition for the latter one you could access the token level enttype and entiob attributes to iterate over the tokens in the processed docs once and then merge these ngrams together based on their iobtags

75179250,is splitting a long document of a dataset for bert considered bad practice,machinelearning nlp classification bertlanguagemodel textclassification,you have not mentioned if your intention is to classify but given that you refer to an article on classification i will refer to an approach where you classify the whole text the main question is which part of the text is the most informative for your purpose or in other words does it make sense to use more than the first last split of text when considering long passages of text frequently it is enough to consider the first or last tokens to correctly predict the class in substantial majority of cases say even though you may loose some precision you gain on speed and performance of the overall solution and you are getting rid of a nasty problem of figuring out the correct class out of a set of classifications why consider an example of text tokens long you split it by tokens obtaining pieces notice the small last piece should you even consider it your target class for this text is say a however you get the following predictions on the pieces a b a b c so you have now a headache to figure out the right method to determine the class you can use majority voting but it is not conclusive here weight the predictions by the length of the piece again non conclusive check that prediction of the last piece is class c but it is barely above the threshold and class c is kinda a so you are leaning towards a reclassify starting the split from the end in the same order as before you get a b c a a so clearly a you also get it when you majority vote combining all of the classifications forward and backward splits consider the confidence of the classifications eg a b a b c avg for a vs for b reconfirm the correction of labelling of the last piece manually if it turns out to be b then it changes all of the above then you can train an additional network to classify out of the raw classifications of pieces getting again into trouble of figuring out what to do with particularly long sequences or nonconclusive combinations of predictions resulting in poor confidence of the additional classification layer it turns out that there is no easy way and you will notice that text is a strange classification material exhibiting all of the above and more issues while typically the difference in agreement between the first piece prediction and the annotation vs the ultimate perfect classifier is slim at best so spare the effort and strive for simplicity performance and heuristic and clip it on details of the best practices you should probably refer to the article from this answer

72355671,huggingface longformer case sensitive tokenizer,python nlp huggingfacetransformers textclassification huggingfacetokenizers,in my opinion it is better not to modify tokenization schemes of pretrained transformers they were pretrained with a certain vocabulary and changing it may lead to their deterioration if you still want to make the system insensitive to capitalization and if you want to use the same model and the same tokenizer without modifying them too much then just lowercasing the input data is a sensible strategy however if you are willing to spend resources on updating the model and the tokenizer you can do the following modify the tokenizer add a lowercase normalizer into its pipeline optionally modify the vocabulary of the tokenizer drop the unused words that contain uppercase characters and maybe add some lowercase words the embedding and output layers of the model should be modified accordingly and there is no standardized code for this so such manipulations are not recommended unless you understand well what you are doing still such manipulations could improve model performance finetune the model with the original masked language modelling task on a large dataset using the updated tokenizer this will make the neural network better aware of the new lowercase texts that it may discover this will make the system better adapted to uncased texts but it will cost you time to write the code for updating the vocabulary and computational resources to finetune the model

64879678,sligthly different word frequency after text tokenization,python tensorflow keras plot nlp,well in the first case you use split to tokenize your words which splits by space between words this sentence is a sentence results in the tokens this sentence is a sentence but the tokenizer from keras removes punctuation as described here by default all punctuation is removed turning the texts into spaceseparated sequences of words words maybe include the character these sequences are then split into lists of tokens they will then be indexed or vectorized so the tokens from kerastokenizer would look like this this sentence is a sentencedid you notice the missing dot in the end as you can see the count of the token sentence is different compared to the first method being two in the second case i guess this is at least one reason why the two diagrams are not the same

64684506,transformers get named entity prediction for words instead of tokens,nlp pytorch huggingfacetransformers,there are two questions here annotating token classification a common sequential tagging especially in named entity recognition follows the scheme that a sequence to tokens with tag x at the beginning gets bx and on reset of the labels it gets ix the problem is that most annotated datasets are tokenized with space for example where o indicates that it is not a namedentity bartist is the beginning of the sequence of tokens labelled as artist and iartist is inside the sequence similar pattern for medium at the moment i posted this answer there is an example of ner in huggingface documentation here the example doesnt exactly answer the question here but it can add some clarification the similar style of named entity labels in that example could be as follows adapt tokenizations with all that said about annotation schema bert and several other models have different tokenization model so we have to adapt these two tokenizations in this case with bertbaseuncased the expected outcome is like this in order to get this done you can go through each token in original annotation then tokenize it and add its label again when you add cls and sep in the tokens their labels o must be added to labels with the code above it is possible to get into a situation that a beginning tag like bartist get repeated when the beginning word splits into pieces according to the description in huggingface documentation you can encode these labels with to be ignored something like this should work

64606333,bert embeddings in sparknlp or bert for token classification in huggingface,nlp bertlanguagemodel huggingfacetransformers johnsnowlabssparknlp,to answer your question no hugging face uses different head for different tasks this is almost the same as what the authors of bert did with their model they added taskspecific layer on top of the existing model to finetune for a particular task one thing that must be noted here is that when you add task specific layer a new layer you jointly learn the new layer and update the existing learnt weights of the bert model so basically your bert model is part of gradient updates this is quite different from obtaining the embeddings and then using it as input to neural nets question when you obtain the embeddings and use it for another complex model i am not sure how to quantify in terms of loosing the information because you are still using the information obtained using bert from your data to build another model so we cannot attribute to loosing the information but the performance need not be the best when compared with learning another model on top of bert and along with bert often people would obtain the embeddings and then as input to another the classifier due to resource constraint where it may not be feasible to train or finetune bert

64135736,how to split prefix and suffix in python,python unix nlp,here is a rough approximation of what you seem to be asking using regular expressions by way of the python re library import re m rematchr word if m prefix root suffix mgroups your examples also seem to have and as separators but extending this to allow for those as well should be relatively straightforward once you understand how this is working in brief rematch returns false if the regex doesnt match and otherwise it returns a match object whose groups method contains the text which matched the grouping parentheses in the regular expression parentheses are nongrouping parentheses without immediately after the opening parenthesis capture into a group the expression can be divided into the following nongrouping expression to skip anything in braces nongrouping wrapper around a grouping expression for anything before a dash main root grouping expression to capture text which doesnt match one of the delimiters nongrouping expression to ignore anything after a slash similar to the dash capture any suffix after with a nongrouping wrapper around the whole group and then a grouping capture for the text after the delimiter this will seem intimidating at first but once you have deciphered the first couple you should understand how they all work in some more detail lets examine the dash expression we need a noncapturing group to mark all of this as optional down at the end capture any matching text between the grouping parentheses into a group match a single character which is not or or or or actually one or more of the previous as many as possible end of capture as long as all of this ends in a literal dash all of this is optional if skipping this will allow the overall expression to match the regex engine will but it will still prefer to match if possible this is called greedy matching notice how keeps appearing in all of these groups we dont want to allow the text we capture to match one of the delimiters you dont specify what to do with spaces so this simply regards them as any other character perhaps you want to keep them out of groups when they are adjacent to a delimiter too demo

64073249,why does keraspreprocessingsequence padsequences process characters instead of words,python keras nlp speechtotext textprocessing,the tokenizers methods such as fitontexts or textstosequences expect a list of textsstrings as input as their name suggests ie texts however you are passing a single textstring to them and therefore it would iterate over its characters instead while assuming its actually a list one way of resolving this is to add a check at the beginning of each function to make sure that the input data type is actually a list for example you should also do this for the tokenizetext function after this change your custom functions would work on both a single string as well as a list of strings as an important side note if the code you have put in your question belongs to the prediction phase there is a fundamental error in it you should use the same tokenizer instance you have used when training the model to ensure the mapping and tokenization is done the same way as in training phase actually it does not make sense to create a new tokenizer instance for each or all test samples unless it has the same mapping and configuration as the one used in training phase
64023547,inconsistent vector representation using transformers bertmodel and berttokenizer,python nlp bertlanguagemodel huggingfacetransformers,when you do it in single sentence per batch the maximum length of the sentence is maximum number of tokens however when you do it in batch the maximum length of the sentences remains the same across the batch which defaults to the maximum number of tokens in the longest sentence the max values of in this case indicates its not a token and indicates a token the best way to control this is to define the maximum sequence length and truncate the sentences longer than the maximum sequence length this can be done using an alternative method to tokenize the text in batches a single sentence can be considered as batchsize of
64013808,why bert model have to keep mask token unchanged,deeplearning nlp bertlanguagemodel,this is done because they want to pretrain a bidirectional model most of the time the network will see a sentence with a mask token and its trained to predict the word that is supposed to be there but in finetuning which is done after pretraining finetuning is the training done by everyone who wants to use bert on their task there are no mask tokens unless you specifically do masked lm this mismatch between pretraining and training sudden disappearence of the mask token is softened by them with a probability of the word is not replaced by mask the task is still there the network has to predict the token but it actually gets the answer already as input this might seem counterintuitive but makes sense when combined with the mask training

61760508,how to choose numwords parameter for keras tokenizer,tensorflow machinelearning keras nlp tokenize,the base question here is what kinds of words establish sentiment and how often do they occur in tweets which of course has no hard and fast answer heres how i would solve this preprocess your data so you remove conjunctions stop words and junk from tweets get the number of unique words in your corpus are all of these words essential to convey sentiment analyze the words with the top frequencies are these words that convey sentiment could they be removed in your preprocessing the tokenizer records the first n unique words until the dictionary has numwords in it so these popular words are much more likely to be in your dictionary then i would begin experimenting with different values and see the effects on your output apologies for no real answer i would argue that there is no single true strategy to choosing this value instead the answer should come from leveraging the characteristics and statistics of your data

61445913,how do i preprocess and tokenize a tensorflow csvdataset inside the map method,python tensorflow keras nlp tensorflowdatasets,first of all lets find out the problems in your code the first problem which is also the reason behind the given error is that the fitontexts method accepts a list of texts not a single text string therefore it should be tokfitontextsinputs after fixing that and running the code again you would get another error attributeerror tensor object has no attribute lower this is due to the fact that the elements in the dataset are tensor objects and the map function should be able to handle them however the tokenizer class is not designed to handle tensor objects there is a fix for this problem but i wont address it now because of the next problem the biggest problem is that each time the map function ie preprocess is called a new instance of tokenizer class is created and it would be fit on a single text document update as princy correctly pointed out in the comments section the fitontexts method actually performs a partial fit ie updates or augments the internal vocabulary stats instead of starting from scratch so if we create the tokenizer class outside the preprocess function and assuming the vocabulary set is known beforehand otherwise you cant filter the most frequent words in a partial fit scheme unless you have or build the vocabulary set first then it would be possible to use this approach ie based on tokenizer class after applying the above fixes as well however personally i prefer the solution below so what should we do as mentioned above in almost all of the models which deal with text data we first need to convert the texts into numerical features ie encode them for performing encoding first we need a vocabulary set or a dictionary of tokens therefore the steps we should take are as follows if there is a prebuilt vocabulary available then skip to the next step otherwise tokenize all the text data first and build the vocabulary encode the text data using the vocabulary set for performing the first step we use tfdsfeaturestexttokenizer to tokenize text data and build the vocabulary by iterating over the dataset for the second step we use tfdsfeaturestexttokentextencoder to encode the text data using the vocabulary set built in previous step note that for this step we are using map method however since map only functions in graph mode we have wrapped our encode function in tfpyfunction so that it could be used with map here is the code please read the comments in the code for additional points i have not included them in the answer because they are not directly relevant but they are useful and practical side note for future readers notice that the order of arguments ie target text and the data types are based on the ops dataset adapt as needed based on your own datasettask although at the end ie return textencoded target we adjusted this to make it compatible with expected format of fit method

61134275,difficulty in understanding the tokenizer used in roberta model,nlp pytorch huggingfacetransformers bertlanguagemodel,this question is extremely broad so im trying to give an answer that focuses on the main problem at hand if you feel the need to have other questions answered please open another question focusing on one question at a time see the helpontopic rules for stackoverflow essentially as youve correctly identified bpe is central to any tokenization in modern deep networks i highly recommend you to read the original bpe paper by sennrich et al in which they also highlight a bit more of the history of bpes in any case the tokenizers for any of the huggingface models are pretrained meaning that they are usually generated from the training set of the algorithm beforehand common implementations such as sentencepiece also give a bit better understanding of it but essentially the task is framed as a constrained optimization problem where you specify a maximum number of k allowed vocabulary words the constraint and the algorithm tries to then keep as many words intact without exceeding k if there are not enough words to cover the whole vocabulary smaller units are used to approximate the vocabulary which results in the splits observed in the example you gave roberta uses a variant called bytelevel bpe the best explanation is probably given in this study by wang et al the main benefit is that it results in a smaller vocabulary while maintaining the quality of splits from what i understand the second part of your question is easier to explain while bert highlights the merging of two subsequent tokens with robertas tokenizer instead highlights the start of a new token with a specific unicode character in this case u the g with a dot the best reason i could find for this was this thread which argues that it basically avoids the use of whitespaces in training

60661508,split into test and train set before or after generating document term matrix,python machinelearning nlp datascience,qualitatively you dont need to do it either way however proper procedure requires that you keep your training and test data entirely separate the overall concept is that the test data are not directly represented in the training this helps reduce overfitting the test data and later validation data are samples that the trained model has never encountered during training therefore the test data should not be included in your preprocessing the documentterm matrix this breaks the separation in that the model has in one respect seen the test data during training quantitatively you need to do the split first because that matrix is to be used for training the model against only the training set when you included the test data in the matrix you obtained a matrix that is slightly inaccurate in representing the training data it no longer properly represents the data youre actually training against this is why your model isnt quite as good as the one that followed proper separation procedures its a subtle difference most of all because the training and test sets are supposed to be random samples of the same population of possible inputs random differences provide the small surprise you encountered

56870701,how to fix tokenizing phrases such as tc from being split into t c,pythonx nlp nltk,the tokenizers that come with nlp systems are sometimes pretty basic and even advanced ones may handle some edge cases in ways you might not prefer for a particular project bottom line you have several options find an offtheshelf solution that does exactly what you want find a setting or configuration that adjusts one to do what you want stanford nltk has several variations such as casual mwetokenizer nist and punkt and some options like adding your own regexes to some of them see write code to change an existing solution if its open source you can change the code itself many systems also have an api that lets you override certain parts without digging too far into the guts write you own tokenizer from scratch this is considerably harder than it looks pre or postprocess the data to fix specific problems but ampersand may not be the only case youll run into i suggest going through each punctuation mark in turn and spending a minute thinking about what you want to happen when it shows up then youll have a clearer set of goals in mind when evaluating your options for example also shows up in urls and be careful of lt if youre parsing html and if youre parsing code you probably dont want to tokenize urls at every slash and certainly dont want to try parsing the resulting tokens as if they were a sentence theres also and many more cases hypens are highly ambiguous the double hyphen for clauselevel dash and the decrement operator in some code endofline hyphenation which might or might not want to be closed up long strings of hyphens as separator lines quotes curly vs straight singlequote vs apostrophe for contractions or possessives or incorrectly for plurals and so on unicode introduces cases like different types of whitespace quotes and dashes many editors like to autocorrect to unicode characters like those and even fractions may end up as a single character do you want the tokenizer to break that into tokens its fairly easy and imho an extremely useful exercise to write up a small set of test cases and try them out some of the existing tokenizers can be tried out online for example stanford corenlp python nltk spacy morphadorner this is just a small sample there are many others and some of these have a variety of options if you want a really quickanddirty solution for just this one case you could postprocess the token list to recombine the problem cases or preprocess it to turn rww into some magic string that the tokenizer wont break up than turn it back afterward those are pretty much hacks but in limited circumstances they might be ok

55382596,how is wordpiece tokenization helpful to effectively deal with rare words problem in nlp,nlp wordembedding,wordpiece and bpe are two similar and commonly used techniques to segment words into subwordlevel in nlp tasks in both cases the vocabulary is initialized with all the individual characters in the language and then the most frequentlikely combinations of the symbols in the vocabulary are iteratively added to the vocabulary consider the wordpiece algorithm from the original paper wording slightly modified by me initialize the word unit inventory with all the characters in the text build a language model on the training data using the inventory from generate a new word unit by combining two units out of the current word inventory to increment the word unit inventory by one choose the new word unit out of all the possible ones that increases the likelihood on the training data the most when added to the model goto until a predefined limit of word units is reached or the likelihood increase falls below a certain threshold the bpe algorithm only differs in step where it simply chooses the new word unit as the combination of the next most frequently occurring pair among the current set of subword units example input text she walked he is a dog walker i walk first bpe merges w a wa l k lk wa lk walk so at this stage your vocabulary includes all the initial characters along with wa lk and walk you usually do this for a fixed number of merge operations how does it handle rareoov words quite simply oov words are impossible if you use such a segmentation method any word which does not occur in the vocabulary will be broken down into subword units similarly for rare words given that the number of subword merges we used is limited the word will not occur in the vocabulary so it will be split into more frequent subwords how does this help imagine that the model sees the word walking unless this word occurs at least a few times in the training corpus the model cant learn to deal with this word very well however it may have the words walked walker walks each occurring only a few times without subword segmentation all these words are treated as completely different words by the model however if these get segmented as walk ing walk ed etc notice that all of them will now have walk in common which will occur much frequently while training and the model might be able to learn more about it

53525994,how to find numwords or vocabulary size of keras tokenizer when one is not assigned,machinelearning keras deeplearning nlp tokenize,all the words and their indices will be stored in a dictionary which you can access it using tokenizerwordindex therefore you can find the number of the unique words based on the number of elements in this dictionary that is because of reserving padding ie index zero note this solution obviously is applicable when you have not set numwords argument ie you dont know or want to limit the number of words since wordindex contains all the words and not only the most frequent words no matter you set numwords or not
53514277,unindent does not match any outer indentation level when i about to tokenize the string,python nlp nltk,your code probably has whitespaces and tabs mixed with each other one way to solve this would be replacing all spaces with tabs or vice versa but as mentioned by pep recommends spaces so use spaces try this and it should work

53212374,how to get token ids using spacy i want to map a text sentence to sequence of integers,nlp spacy wordembedding,spacy uses hashing on texts to get unique ids all token objects have multiple forms for different use cases of a given token in a document if you just want the normalised form of the tokens then use the norm attribute which is a integer representation of the text hashed you can also use other attributes such as the lowercase integer attribute lower or many other things use help on the document or token to get more information
53129516,add exception in spacy tokenizer to not break the tokens with whitespaces,pythonx nlp spacy cosinesimilarity wordembedding,spacy also lets you do document similarity averages word embeddings for words but that is better than what you are doing now so one way to approach this is to compare an item in list and list directly without doing it token by token for example this will print me something like is this what you want

52922704,berkeley parser english different results online vs offline,nlp,there are two reasons coming to my mind regarding this situation they might have used a different grammar in online version they might have splitted the sentences before parsing and merged sentences into the root node in the online version you may want to split sentences beforehand and then parse the sentences individually as well statistical parsers are trained with sentences to my knowlegde berkeley parser is an unlexicalized parser which is also trained with sentences yet it may be more complicated to parse more tokens for it as you can see in your outputs the term immediately is postagged as a noun so you can give it a try to split the sentences first then parse and see how it goes after cheers
52897492,spacy optimizing tokenization,machinelearning nlp spacy,it sounds like you havent optimised the pipeline yet youll get a significant speed up from disabling the pipeline components you dont need like so this should get you down to about the twominute mark or better on its own if you need a further speed up you can look at multithreading using nlppipe docs for multithreading are here

52063689,how to maintain index when splitting sentences into words and reapplying sentiment polarity to each word,python pandas indexing nlp textblob,an easy option here just use pandas built in to solve this first strip special characters then convert each word to a column next apply textblob to each word and extract the polarity from the blob lastly take the mean of each row edit the above solution will only work for equal length sentences use this for a general case
52048757,how to split every sentence into individual words and average polarity score per sentence and append into new column in dataframe,python pandas dataframe nlp textblob,i have the impression the sentiment polarity only works on textblob type so my idea here is to split the text blob into words with the split function see doc here and convert them to textblob objects this is done in the list comprehension so the whole thing looks like this

51956000,what does keras tokenizer method exactly do,python keras nlp,from the source code fitontexts updates internal vocabulary based on a list of texts this method creates the vocabulary index based on word frequency so if you give it something like the cat sat on the mat it will create a dictionary st wordindexthe wordindexcat it is word index dictionary so every word gets a unique integer value is reserved for padding so lower integer means more frequent word often the first few are stop words because they appear a lot textstosequences transforms each text in texts to a sequence of integers so it basically takes each word in the text and replaces it with its corresponding integer value from the wordindex dictionary nothing more nothing less certainly no magic involved why dont combine them because you almost always fit once and convert to sequences many times you will fit on your training corpus once and use that exact same wordindex dictionary at train eval testing prediction time to convert actual text into sequences to feed them to the network so it makes sense to keep those methods separate

50908667,tokenization not working the same for both case,nlp spacy,just like language itself tokenization is contextdependent and the languagespecific data defines rules that tell spacy how to split the text based on the surrounding characters spacys defaults are also optimised for generalpurpose text like news text web texts and other modern writing in your example youve come across an interesting case the abstract string xxxmessageid is split on punctuation while the isolated lowercase string id is split into i and d because in written text its most commonly an alternate spelling of id or id i could i would etc you can find the respective ruleshere if youre dealing with specific texts that are substantially different from regular natural language texts you usually want to customise the tokenization rules or possibly even add a language subclass for your own custom dialect if theres a fixed number of cases you want to tokenize differently that can be expressed by rules another option would be to add a component to your pipeline that merges the split tokens back together finally you could also try using the languageindependent xx multilanguage class instead it still includes very basic tokenization rules like splitting on punctuation but none of the rules specific to the english language

50752266,spacy tokenize quoted string,pythonx nlp spacy,while you could modify the tokenizer and add your own custom prefix suffix and infix rules that exclude quotes im not sure this is the best solution here for your use case it might make more sense to add a component to your pipeline that merges certain quoted strings into one token before the tagger parser and entity recognizer are called to accomplish this you can use the rulebased matcher and find combinations of tokens surrounded by the following pattern looks for one or more alphanumeric characters heres a visual example of the pattern in the interactive matcher demo to do the merging you can then set up the matcher add the pattern and write a function that takes a doc object extracts the matched spans and merges them into one token by calling their merge method for a more elegant solution you can also refactor the component as a reusable class that sets up the matcher in its init method see the docs for examples if you add the component first in the pipeline all other components like the tagger parser and entity recognizer will only get to see the retokenized doc thats also why you might want to write more specific patterns that only merge certain quoted strings you care about in your example the new token boundaries improve the predictions but i can also think of many other cases where they dont especially if the quoted string is longer and contains a significant part of the sentence
50742516,how to get the index of a token in a sentence in spacy,nlp spacy dependencyparsing,a spacy doc object also lets you iterate over the docsents which are span objects of the individual sentence to get a spans start and end index in the parent document you can look at the start and end attribute so if you iterate over the sentences and subtract the sentence start index from the tokeni you get the tokens relative index within the sentence the default sentence segmentation uses the dependency parse which is usually more accurate however you can also plug in a rulebased or entirely custom solution see here for details

50330455,how to detokenize spacy text without doc context,nlp spacy,internally spacy keeps track of a boolean array to tell whether the tokens have trailing whitespace you need this array to put the string back together if youre using a seqseq model you could predict the spaces separately james bradbury author of torchtext was complaining to me about exactly this hes right that i didnt think about seqseq models when i designed the tokenization system in spacy he developed revtok to solve his problem basically what revtok does if i understand correctly is pack two extra bits onto the lexeme ids whether the lexeme has an affinity for a preceding space and whether it has an affinity for a following space spaces are inserted between tokens whose lexemes both have space affinity heres the code to find these bits for a spacy doc def hasprespacetoken if tokeni return false if tokennborwhitespace return true else return false def hasspacetoken return tokenwhitespace the trick is that you drop a space when either the current lexeme says no trailing space or the next lexeme says no leading space this means you can decide which of those two lexemes to blame for the lack of the space using frequency statistics jamess point is that this strategy adds very little entropy to the word prediction decision alternate schemes will expand the lexicon with entries like hello or hello his approach does neither because you can code the string hello as either hello or as hello this choice is easy we should definitely blame the period for the lack of the space

48980120,is it possible to parse emojis using spacy,python nlp emoji spacy,yes spacy actually includes a pretty comprehensive list of textbased emoticons as part of its tokenizer exceptions so using your example above and printing the individual tokens the emoticon is tokenized correctly i think what happens here is that you actually came across an interesting maybe nonideal edge case with the displacy defaults to avoid very long dependency arcs for punctuation the collapsepunct setting defaults to true this means that when the visualisation is rendered punctuation is merged onto the preceding token punctuation is identified by checking whether the tokens ispunct attribute returns true which also happens to be the case for in your example you can work around this by setting collapsepunct to false in the options passed to displacyserve the displacy visualizer should probably include an exception for emoticons when merging punctuation this is currently difficult because spacy doesnt have an isemoji or issymbol flag however it might be a nice addition in the future you can vote for it on this thread

44395656,applying spacy parser to pandas dataframe w multiprocessing,python nlp multiprocessing spacy,spacy is highly optimised and does the multiprocessing for you as a result i think your best bet is to take the data out of the dataframe and pass it to the spacy pipeline as a list rather than trying to use apply directly you then need to the collate the results of the parse and put this back into the dataframe so in your example you could use something like this approach will work fine on small datasets but it eats up your memory so not great if you want to process huge amounts of text

41276039,why nltk uses regular expressions for word tokenization but training for sentence tokenization,python nlp nltk,im not sure if you can say that sentence splitting is harder than word tokenisation but tokenisation depends on sentence splitting so errors in sentence splitting will propagate to tokenisation therefore youd want to have reliable sentence splitting so that you dont have to make up for it in tokenisation and it turns out that once you have good sentence splitting tokenisation works pretty well with regexes why is that one of the major ambiguities in tokenisation in latin script languages at least is the period it can be a full stop thus a token of its own an abbreviation mark belonging to that abbreviation token or something special like part of a url a decimal fraction once the sentence splitter has figured out the first case full stops the tokeniser can concentrate on the rest and identifying stuff like urls is exactly what you would use a regex for isnt it the sentence splitters main job on the other hand is to find abbreviations with a period you can create a list for that by hand or you can train it on a big text collection the good thing is its unsupervised training you just feed in the plain text and the splitter collects abbreviations the intuition is if a token almost always appears with a period then its probably an abbreviation

38545726,how to use the link grammar parser as a grammar checker,python parsing nlp grammar linkgrammar,i cant help you to mimic the grammarchecking abilities of abiword using python bindings but i can at least help you to build it and check out its functionalities building with ms visual studio bit architecture id normally say that the best method to achieve this is to build the link grammar library and python bindings on a linux machine following the extensive instructions in their readme file however judging by your comment above linux may not be an option and it seems you want to stick to using visual studio over using eg cygwin dependencies regex as stated in the readme the link grammar library depends on some form of posixcompliant regex library on linux this is bakedin however in windows you get to or rather have to choose an implementation of the library to use luckily version of the port provided by gnuwin played nicely with the visual studio solutionproject files provided by link grammar found under linkgrammarmsvc however you have to ensure that the visual studio build macro gnuregexdir points to the directory you unpacked the regex library to eg dprogram files xgnuwin note however that these build macros are not the same as windows environment variables despite setting an environment variable under windows called gnuregexdir visual studio did not make use of this variable until i changed the definition of the build macros in the link grammar project files namely in linkgrammarmsvclocalprops the line to swig in order to create python bindings you need to have swig on your system however in order for the build defined by the visual studio project pythonvcxproj to find the swig executable you need to add the respective directory to the windows path eg dprogram files xswigwin just as with the regex library you need to configure the vs project in order to be able to locate your python directory eg change cpython in localprops to python if you have a corresponding environment variable set building once all the above libraries can be found by visual studio the build process is pretty painless just build the project python and if you have the vs solution file open linkgrammarsln it should automatically build the projects linkgrammar and linkgrammarexe which it depends on resolving shared libraries after building the executable you still need to ensure that the regex shared library dll can be found in order to do this the the directory containing the required library in this case regexdll should be on your path it is probably easiest to add the directory to your global path eg gnuregexdirbin in the case of using the gnuwin library mentioned above with the environment variable gnuregexdir pointing to it running with python now that you have tested that windows executable does run and the python bindings have been built you can then import them into a python script in order to ensure they are correctly imported and swig has correctly located the appropriate dlls the link grammar readme mentions running the executable script makecheckpy to load and run your script using link grammar where outdir is the directory to which your python bindings were written eg windebugpython unfortunately however despite that this file is mentioned in the readme for version it is in fact not present in the stable version distributable despite that there is a version of it in the github master repository you can however simply get that one file from the git repository and then use it in the msvc directory of your distributable as stated above however this script requires that regexdll be on the windows path if it hasnt been added to the global path you will have to add it to the path accessible to the python executable when running the script c api vs python api i havent used the link grammar parser much myself and so cant help you there but you can still get an idea how to use them by looking at the c code for the project linkgrammarexe you can start by looking at the main function in linkparserlinkparserc in the simple cli program built by the vs project it simply checks numlinkages and if the value thereof is it displays no complete linkages found which a user can interpret as meaning that the sentence is ungrammatical this behavior can of course be tweaked to accept lowerscoring parses find the words which dont fit etc and so you can explore the functionalities using the c api first later if you really want to use the python bindings the python methods are named similarly to their c counterparts see the file clinkgrammarpy

35345761,python resplit vs nltk wordtokenize and senttokenize,python regex nlp nltk tokenize,the default nltkwordtokenize is using the treebank tokenizer that emulates the tokenizer from the penn treebank tokenizer do note that strsplit doesnt achieve tokens in the linguistics sense eg it is usually used to separate strings with specified delimiter eg in a tabseparated file you can use strsplitt or when you are trying to split a string by the newline n when your textfile has one sentence per line and lets do some benchmarking in python out if we try a another tokenizers in bleeding edge nltk from out note the source of the text file is from if we look at the native perl implementation the python vs perl time for the toktoktokenizer is comparable but do that in the python implementation the regexes are precompiled while in perl it isnt but then the proof is still in the pudding note when timing the toktokpl we had to pipe the output into a file so the timing here includes the time the machine takes to output to file whereas in the nltktokenizetoktoktokenizer timing its doesnt include time to output into a file with regards to senttokenize its a little different and comparing speed benchmark without considering accuracy is a little quirky consider this if a regex splits a textfileparagraph up in sentence then the speed is almost instantaneous ie work done but that would be a horrible sentence tokenizer if sentences in a file is already separated by n then that is simply a case of comparing how strsplitn vs resplitn and nltk would have nothing to do with the sentence tokenization p for information on how senttokenize works in nltk see training data format for nltk punkt use of punktsentencetokenizer in nltk so to effectively compare senttokenize vs other regex based methods not strsplitn one would have to evaluate also the accuracy and have a dataset with humanly evaluated sentence in a tokenized format consider this task given the text in the third category he included those brothers the majority who saw nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance such were willarski and even the grand master of the principal lodge finally to the fourth category also a great many brothers belonged particularly those who had lately joined these according to pierres observations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire for anything but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young brothers who were influential through their connections or rank and of whom there were very many in the lodgepierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing freemasonry at any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals he did not think of doubting freemasonry itself but suspected that russian masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles and so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the orderwhat is to be done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthrow everything repel force by forceno we are very far from that every violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs no violence but what is there in running across it like that said ilagins groom once she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take it ilagin was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop and his excitement we want to get this so simply doing strsplitn will give you nothing even without considering the order of the sentences you will yield positive result

30808806,separately tokenizing and postagging with corenlp,java nlp stanfordnlp,it seems to me that you would be better off separating the tokenization phase from your other downstream tasks so im basically answering question you have two options tokenize using the stanford tokenizer example from stanford corenlp usage page the annotators options should only take tokenizer in your case once you do this you can ask the other modules to not tokenize your input for example the stanford parser has a commandline flag tokenized which you can set to indicate that your input is already tokenized use a different tokenizer say nltk to tokenize and follow the second part of infact if you use any extrinsic tool to split text into sentences basically chunks that you dont want to split any further you have the option of setting a commandline flag in the corenlp tools which will not try and split your input again for the stanford parser this is done by using the sentences newline flag this is probably the easiest thing to do provided you have a reliable sentence detector

28341007,cutting down on stanford parsers timetoparse by pruning the sentence,parsing nlp textprocessing textparsing textanalysis,you asked for creative approaches the cell closure pruning method might be worth a look see the series of publications by brian roark kristy hollingshead and nathan bodenstab papers the basic intuition is each cell in the cyk parse chart covers a certain span eg the first words of the sentence or words etc some words particularly in certain contexts are very unlikely to begin a multiword syntactic constituent others are similarly unlikely to end a constituent for example the word the almost always precedes a noun phrase and its almost inconceivable that it would end a constituent if we can train a machinelearned classifier to identify such words with very high precision we can thereby identify cells which would only participate in parses placing said words in highly improbable syntactic positions note that this classifier might make use of a lineartime pos tagger or other highspeed preprocessing steps by closing these cells we can reduce both the the asymptotic and averagecase complexities considerably in theory from cubic complexity all the way to linear practically we can achieve approximately n without loss of accuracy in many cases this pruning actually increases accuracy slightly vs an exhaustive search because the classifier can incorporate information that isnt available to the pcfg note that this is a simple but very effective form of coarsetofine pruning with a single coarse stage as compared to the stage ctf approach in the berkeley parser to my knowledge the stanford parser doesnt currently implement this pruning technique i suspect youd find it quite effective shameless plug the bubs parser implements this approach as well as a few other optimizations and thus achieves throughput of around words per second usually with accuracy at least equal to that ive measured with the stanford parser obviously if youre using the rest of the stanford pipeline the builtin parser is already well integrated and convenient but if you need improved speed bubs might be worth a look and it does include some example code to aid in embedding the engine in a larger system memoizing common substrings regarding your thoughts on preanalyzing known noun phrases or other frequentlyobserved sequences with consistent structure i did some evaluation of a similar idea a few years ago in the context of sharing common substructures across a large corpus when parsing on a massively parallel architecture the preliminary results werent encouragingin the corpora we looked at there just werent enough repeated substrings of substantial length to make it worthwhile and the aforementioned cell closure methods usually make those substrings really cheap to parse anyway however if your target domains involved a lot of repetition you might come to a different conclusion maybe it would be effective on legal documents with lots of copyandpaste boilerplate or news stories that are repeated from various sources or republished with edits

28249717,swapping in berkley parser in stanford corenlp,nlp stanfordnlp,the difficult but clean way to do this would be to build your own annotator which hooks into a programmatic api of the berkeley parser youd basically want to imitate the behavior of the parserannotator replacing the references to the stanford parserquery implementation with references to berkeley parser code that makes the necessary transformations then using the results returned by the berkeley parser transformed into the stanford framework you can use englishgrammaticalstructure to convert the berkeley constituency parse to dependency trees the less clean but perhaps easier way would be to have the berkeley parser output a ptbformat parse and use the main method of englishgrammaticalstructure to generate from this conllformat dependency parses more information on the first option as requested you should make your own annotator which composes with subclasses parserannotator the key method to override is parserannotatordoonesentence here you can call out to the berkeley parser api parse its results and call parserannotatorfinishsentence with the properly converted tree finishsentence should take care of putting the correct annotations in place for you you can easily hook in your custom annotator on the main pipeline using a special property see this so answer for example code im referring to the customannotatorclass property
28129365,regex tokenpattern for scikitlearn text vectorizer,regex machinelearning nlp scikitlearn tokenize,tldr if you ever write a regex over characters youre doing something wrong but it might be an acceptable hack if you write a regex over characters you need to stop immediately let me just start off by saying that this should in no way shape or form be solved by a regex most of the steps that you describe should be handle in preprocessing or postprocessing you shouldnt try to come up with a regex that filters something that starts with deleted tweet or rt you should ignore these lines in preprocessing ignore unicode then probably worth getting off the internet since literally everything on the internet and everything outside of notepad is unicode if you want to remove all unicode characters that cant be represented in ascii which is what i assume you meant then the encoding step is the place to fix this as far as ignoring http goes you should just set http as a stopword this can be passed in as another argument to the vectorizer youre using once thats done the token regex you use probably still not a case for regex but that is the interface that sklearn offers is actually very simple where the only change to be implemented here is the ignoring of numerics like mg mentioned above its worth noting that this heavy level of token removal is going to negatively affect pretty much any analysis youre trying to do if you have a decentsized corpus you shouldnt remove any tokens if its small removing stop words and using a stemmer or a lemmatizer is a good way to go but this kind of token removal is poor practice and will lead to overfitting

28073147,finding token probabilies in a text in nlp,java machinelearning nlp tokenize opennlp,the tokenizer probabilities relate to the tokenizers confidence in identifying the token spans themselves whether this string of characters in this context is a token or not according to the tokenizer model this at the beginning of a string with a following space is a very probable token for english while thi with a following s would not be the probabilities do not relate to how often a particular token content has been seen just whether this sequence of characters is a probable token the string is is is is is is is is easy to tokenize for english because is is a common word and spaces are good token boundaries thats it if you are interested in calculating ngram probabilities you should look at language models instead youll still need to tokenize your text first obviously

27865825,how to get dependency parse output exactly as online demo,nlp stanfordnlp,the reason for the different output is that if you use the parser demo the standalone parser distribution is being used and your code uses the entire corenlp distribution while both of them use the same parser and the same models the default configuration of corenlp runs a partofspeech pos tagger before running the parser and the parser incorporates the pos information which can lead to different results in some cases in order to get the same results you can disable the pos tagger by changing the list of annotators note however that the lemma ner and dcoref annotators all require pos tags so you have to change the order of the annotators there is also a corenlp demo which should always produce the same output as your code

27089678,natural language query preprocessing,nlp informationretrieval,tfidf its not capitalized fyi is a good choice of weight your intuition is correct here however you dont compute tfidf on your training set alone why you need to really understand what the tf and idf mean tf term frequency is a statistic that indicates whether a term appears in the document being evaluated the simplest way to calculate it would simply be a boolean value ie if the term is in the document idf inverse document frequency on the other hand measures how likely a term appears in a random document its most often calculated as the log of nnumber of document matches now tf is calculated for each of the document your ir system will be indexing over if you dont have the access to do this then you have a much bigger and insurmountable problem since an ir without a source of truth is an oxymoron ideally idf is calculated over your entire data set ie all the documents you are indexing but if this is prohibitively expensive then you can random sample your population to create a smaller data set or use a training set such as the brown corpus

26070245,clause extraction using stanford parser,nlp stanfordnlp,it is probably better if you primarily use the constituentybased parse tree and not the dependencies the dependencies will be helpful but only after the main work is done i am going to explain this towards the end of my answer this is because constituencyparse is based on phrase structure grammar which is the most relevant if you are seeking to extract clauses from a sentence it can be done using dependencies as well but in that case you will essentially be reconstructing the phrase structure starting from the root and looking at dependent nodes eg abc and facts are the nominal subject and direct object of the verb cites and so on it is helpful to visualize the parse tree however in your example the clauses are indicated by the sbar tag which is a clause introduced by a possibly empty subordinating conjunction all you need to do is the following identify the nonroot clausal nodes in the parse tree remove but retain separately the subtrees rooted at these clausal nodes from the main tree in the main tree after removal of subtrees in step remove any hanging prepositions subordinating conjunctions and adverbs in step what i mean by hanging is that any prepositions etc whose dependency has been removed in step eg from abc cites the fact that you need to remove the prepositionsubordinatingconjunction that because its dependent node banned was removed in step you will thus have three independent clauses chemical additives are banned in many countries sbar removal in step they may be banned in this state too sbar removal in step abc cites the fact step the only issue here is the connection abcfeels for this note that both banned and feels are complements of the verb cites and hence have the same subject which is abc and youre done when this is done you will get a fourth clause abc feels which is something you may or may not want to include in your final result for a list of all clausal tags and in fact all penn treebank tags see this list for an online parsetree visualization you may want to use the online berkeley parser demo it helps a lot in forming a better intuition heres the for your example sentence caveats even the best parsers will not always parse sentences correctly so keep that in mind additionally many complex sentences involve right node raising which is almost never parsed correctly by most parsers you may need to modify the algorithm a little if a clause is in passive voice apart from these three pitfalls the above algorithm should work quite accurately

25102212,how to parse names from raw text,python nlp linguistics,i dont know why you think you need nltk just to rule out dictionary words a simple dictionary which you might have installed somewhere like usrsharedictwords or you can download one off the internet is all you need your words list may include names but if so it will include them capitalized so or if you want to whitelist proper names instead of blacklisting dictionary words but this really isnt going to work look at jim white from your example his last name is obviously going to be in any dictionary and his first name will be in many as a short version of jimmy as a common romanization of the arabic letter jm etc mark is also a common dictionary word and the other way around will is a very common name even though you want to treat it as a word and happiness is an uncommon name but at least a few people have it so to make this work even the slightest bit you probably want to combine multiple heuristics first instead of a word being either always a name or never a name each word has a probability of being used as a name in some relevant corpuswhite may be a name of the time mark jim happiness etc next if its not the first word in a sentence but is capitalized its much more likely to be a name how much more i dont know youll need to test and tune for your particular input and if its lowercase its less likely to be a name you could bring in more contextfor example you have a lot of full names so if something is a possible first name and it appears right next to something thats a common last name its more likely to be a first name you could even try to parse the grammar its ok if you bail on some sentences they just wont get any input from the grammar rule so if two adjacent words only work as part of a sentence one if the second one is a verb theyre probably not a first and last name even if that same second word could be a noun and a name in other contexts and so on
24760948,how can i create nlp parser,nlp,creating a parser is not an easy task you best option is probably to take an offtheshelf statistical parser and train it on an annotated corpus of czech text you will probably have a better success with dependency parsers i found a few useful looking sites and a good introductory text to nlp which includes parsing is speech and language processing by jurafsky and martin this is de facto the bible for nlp you can also look at nltk natural language toolkit for python it will have some parsers included so perhaps you can just train them on the prague dependency treebank

24363145,quick nltk parse into syntax tree,python nlp nltk,parsing is a fairly computationally intensive operation you can probably get much better performance out of a more polished parser such as bllip it is written in c and benefits from a team having worked on it over a prolonged period there is a python module which interacts with it heres an example comparing bllip and the parser you are using and it runs about times faster on my computer also theres a pull request pending on integrating the bllip parser into nltk also you state i cant know that i only know its gonna be english in your question if by this you mean it needs to parse other languages as well it will be much more complicated these statistical parsers are trained on some input often parsed content from the wsj in the penn treebanks some parses will provide trained models for other languages as well but youll need to identify the language first and load an appropriate model into the parser

23813611,parsing messy texts with stanford parser,java errorhandling machinelearning nlp stanfordnlp,this error is basically an out of memory error it likely occurs because there are long stretches of text with no sentence terminating punctuation periods question marks and so it has been and is trying to parse a huge list of words that it regards as a single sentence the parser in general tries to continue after a parse failure but cant in this case because it both failed to create data structures for parsing a longer sentence and then failed to recreate the data structures it was using previously so you need to do something choices are indicate sentenceshort document boundaries yourself this does not require loading the parser many times and you should avoid that from the commandline you can put each sentence in a file and give the parser many documents to parse and ask it to save them in different files see the writeoutputfiles option alternatively and perhaps better you can do this keeping everything in one file by either making the sentences one per line or using simple xmlsgml style tags surrounding each sentence and then to use the sentences newline or parseinside element or you can just avoid this problem by specifying a maximum sentence length longer things that are not sentence divided will be skipped this is great for runtime too you can do this with maxlength if you are writing your own program you could catch this exception and try to resume but it will only be successful if sufficient memory is available unless you take the steps in the earlier bullet points

22510616,faster alternatives to stanford corenlp for obtaining parse trees,java nlp stanfordnlp,if you are using the pcfg or factored models you might consider switching to the new rnn models that are available since version they are much faster alternatively if you only require dependencies there are other parsers you could try eg matetools parser or the clearnlp dependency parser if you need constituents you could try the berkeley parser afaik there are no other parser implementations that have the same api as the stanford parser however there are collections that offer a rather uniform api to different parsers eg dkpro core or cleartk disclosure i am a developer on the dkpro core project
22318532,lexicalized parser vs dependency parser,nlp stanfordnlp,lexicalized parsing aims at building a tree structure from a set of tokens so a correctly parsed sentence could for example return two sub phrases so the syntactical structure of the sentence is identified dependency parsing however aims at finding relations between the words for example consider the sentence i have never ever seen this before a dependency parser could find a directed auxiliary relation from have to seen so a dependency parsing indicates the grammatical relations between this is a rather informal explanation but maybe you can make some use of it

21208568,how to check natural language sentence structure validity using parser in java,parsing nlp,whether you use parse trees or not you will need to use a markov process to check validity the features can be word sequences partofspeech tag sequences parse tree segments ie production rules and their extensions etc for these you would use a tokenizer a pos tagger and a natural language parser respectively the validity check will also be a probabilistic score not an absolute truth all or almost all natural language parsers are statistical which means they require training data these parsers use contextfree grammars or mildly contextsensitive grammars such as ccg or tag which are among the best computational approximations of natural language grammars essentially the model will tell you how likely is it for a feature to appear in a valid sentence after a certain sequence of features has already been seen that is it will allow you to compute probabilities of the form patam working and pathome am the former should have a higher probability than the latter you will need to experimentally determine how high a probability should be in order for a sentence to be considered as valid as qqlihq commented these are under the broad definition of language models for sentence validity however you will usually not need to measure perplexity the conditional probability measures should suffice

17314506,why do i need a tokenizer for each language,text lucene nlp semantics,tokenization is the identification of linguistically meaningful units lmu from the surface text chinese zouk english if you only have time for one club in singapore then it simply has to be zouk indonesian jika anda hanya memiliki waktu untuk satu klub di singapura pergilah ke zouk japanese korean zouk vietnamese nu bn ch c thi gian gh thm mt cu lc b singapore th hy n zouk text source the tokenized version of the parallel text above should look like this for english its simple because each lmu is delimitedseparated by whitespaces however in other languages it might not be the case for most romanized languages such as indonesian they have the same whitespace delimiter that can easily identify a lmu however sometimes an lmu is a combination of two words separated by spaces eg in the vietnamese sentence above you have to read thigian it means time in english as one token and not tokens separating the two words into tokens yields no lmu eg or wrong lmus eg hence a proper vietnamese tokenizer would output thigian as one token rather than thi and gian for some other languages their orthographies might have no spaces to delimit words or tokens eg chinese japanese and sometimes korean in that case tokenization is necessary for computer to identify lmu often there are morphemesinflections attached to an lmu so sometimes a morphological analyzer is more useful than a tokenizer in natural language processing

12366748,nlp how would you parse highly noisy sentence with earley parser,parsing nlp spellchecking fuzzysearch earleyparser,i assume you are using a tagger or lexer stage that is applied before the earley parser ie an algorithm that splits the input string into tokens and looks each token up in a dictionary to determine its partofspeech pos tags it should be possible to build some kind of approximate string lookup aka fuzzy string lookup into that stage so when it is presented with a misspelled token such as lobes instead of loves it will not only identify the tags found by exact string matching lobes as a noun plural of lobe but also tokens that are similar in shape loves as thirdperson singular of verb love this will imply that you generally get a larger number of candidate tags for each token and therefore a larger number of possible parse results during parsing whether or not this will produce the desired result depends on how comprehensive the grammar is and how good the parser is at identifying the correct analysis when presented with many possible parse trees a probabilistic parser may be better for this as it assigns every candidate parse tree a probability or confidence score which may be used to select the most likely or best analysis if this is the solution youd like to try there are several possible implementation strategies firstly if the tokenization and tagging is performed as a simple dictionary lookup ie in the style of a lexer you may simply use a data structure for the dictionary that enables approximate string matching general methods for approximate string comparison are described in approximate string matching algorithms while methods for approximate string lookup in larger dictionaries are discussed in quickly compare a string against a collection in java if however you use an actual tagger as opposed to a lexer ie something that performs pos disambiguation in addition to mere dictionary lookup you will have to build the approximate dictionary lookup into that tagger there must be a dictionary lookup function which is used to generate candidate tags before disambiguation is applied somewhere in the tagger that dictionary lookup will have to be replaced with one that enables approximate string lookup

9560623,data structures for parsed sentence,java parsing tree nlp,the basic approach for this kind of thing is to lex the string into a sequence of tokens and then parse that string into whats called an abstract syntax tree this is a large topic but very briefly lexing means breaking your string down into different logical tokens in your case you probably just want a sequence broken into open and close parentheses and labels so your token is one of or a sequence of nonwhitespace characters that isnt that parsing means reading that sequence of characters and building the tree structure out of it first you need a tree structure in your case its probably a data structure that consists of a sentence that consists of a partofspeech tag and a list of objects that can be either words or subsentences im assuming no interesting structure here if you know that nn can only contain words and np can only contain subsentences or something like that you can make a richer tree structure here next you need to parse your tokens into this tree the easiest ways to do this are pretty simple for instance it looks like here you can just write a function parselist tokens that expects the first token to be an open parenthesis and the second to be a label and then recursively consumes tokens from the sequence until it encounters a closeparenthesis token these topics are the subject of giant books and many libraries and so on but hopefully this will get you started enough to have an idea of how to approach the problem

42471570,how can i split documents into training set and test set,machinelearning scikitlearn textclassification,there will be a few steps get a list of the files randomize the files split files into training and testing sets do the thing get a list of the files lets assume that your files all have the extension data and theyre all in the folder mldata we want to get a list of all of these files this is done simply with the os module im assuming you dont have any subdirectories this would change if there were import os def getfilelistfromdirdatadir allfiles oslistdirospathabspathdatadir datafiles listfilterlambda file fileendswithdata allfiles return datafiles so if we were to call getfilelistfromdirmldata we would get back a list of all the data files in that directory equivalent in the shell to the glob mldatadata randomize the files we dont want the sampling to be predictable as that is considered a poor way to train an ml classifier from random import shuffle def randomizefilesfilelist shufflefilelist note that randomshuffle performs an inplace shuffling so it modifies the existing list of course this function is rather silly since you could just call shuffle instead of randomizefiles you can write this into another function to make it make more sense split files into training and testing sets ill assume a ratio instead of any specific number of documents so from math import floor def gettrainingandtestingsetsfilelist split splitindex floorlenfilelist split training filelistsplitindex testing filelistsplitindex return training testing do the thing this is the step where you open each file and do your training and testing ill leave this to you crossvalidation out of curiosity have you considered using crossvalidation this is a method of splitting your data so that you use every document for training and testing you can customize how many documents are used for training in each fold i could go more into depth on this if you like but i wont if you dont want to do it all right since you requested it i will explain this a little bit more so we have a document set of data the idea of crossvalidation is that you can use all of it for both training and testing just not at once we split the dataset into what we call folds the number of folds determines the size of the training and testing sets at any given point in time lets say we want a fold crossvalidation system this means that the training and testing algorithms will run ten times the first time will train on documents and test on the second fold will train on and test on and if we did say a fold cv system the first fold would train on document and test on the second fold would train on and test on and and on to implement such a system we would still need to do steps and from above but step would be different instead of splitting into just two sets one for training one for testing we could turn the function into a generator a function which we can iterate through like a list def crossvalidatedatafiles folds if lendatafiles folds raise valueerror invalid number of folds for the number of documents formatfolds lendatafiles foldsize lendatafiles folds for splitindex in range lendatafiles foldsize training datafilessplitindexsplitindex foldsize testing datafilessplitindex datafilessplitindex foldsize yield training testing that yield keyword at the end is what makes this a generator to use it you would use it like so def mlfunctiondatadir numfolds datafiles getfilelistfromdirdatadir randomizefilesdatafiles for trainset testset in crossvalidatedatafiles numfolds domltrainingtrainset domltestingtestset again its up to you to implement the actual functionality of your ml system

69338657,keeping numbers in docvec tokenization,python tokenize wordembedding docvec,youre likely going to want to write your own preprocessingtokenization functions but dont worry its not hard to outdo gensims simplepreprocess even with very crude code the only thing docvec needs as the words of a taggeddocument is a list of string tokens typically words so first you might be surprised how well it works to just do a default python string split on your raw strings which just breaks text on whitespace sure a bunch of the resulting tokens will then be mixes of words adjoining punctuation which may be nearly nonsense for example the word lawsuit at the end of the sentence might appear as lawsuit which then wont be recognized as the same token as lawsuit and might not appear enough mincount times to even be considered or otherwise barely rise above serving as noise but especially for both longer documents and larger datasets no one token or even of all tokens has that much influence this isnt exactkeywordsearch where failing to return a document with lawsuit for a query on lawsuit would be a fatal failure a bunch of words lost to such cruft may have hadly any effect on the overall document or model performance as your datasets seem manageable enough to run lots of experiments id suggest trying this dumbestpossible tokenization only split just as a baseline to become confident that the algorithm still mostly works as well as some more intrusive operation like simplepreprocess then as you notice or suspect or ideally measure with some repeatable evaluation that some things youd want to be meaningful tokens arent treated right gradually add extra steps of strippingsplittingcanonicalizing characters or tokens but as much as possible checking that the extra complexity of code and runtime is actually delivering benefits for example further refinements could be some mix of for each token created by the simple split strip off any nonalphanumeric leadingtrailing chars advantages eliminates that punctuationfoulingwords cruft disadvantages might lose useful symbols like the leading of monetary amounts before splitting replace certain singlecharacter punctuationmarks like say with the same character with spaces on both sides so that theyre never connected with nearby words and instead survive a simple split as standalone tokens advantages also prevents wordspluspunctuation cruft disadvantages breaks up numbers like or some useful abbreviations at some appropriate stage in tokenization canonicalize many varied tokens into a smaller set of tokens that may be more meaningful than each of them as rare standalone tokens for example through might all be turned into xx which then has a better chance of influencting the model being associated with tiny amount concepts than the original standalone tokens or replacing all digits with so that numbers of similar magnitudes share influence without diluting the model with a token for every single number the exact mix of heuristics and order of operations will depend on your goals but with a corpus only in the thousands of docs rather than hundredsofthousands or millions even if you do these replacements in a fairly inefficient way lots of individual string or regex replacements in serial itll likely be a manageable preprocessing cost but you can start simple only add complexity that your domainspecific knowledge and evaluations justifies

70502457,do i need to do any text cleaning for spacy ner,python spacy namedentityrecognition,first spacy does no transformation of the input it takes it literally asis and preserves the format so you dont lose any information when you provide text to spacy that said input to spacy with the pretrained pipelines will work best if it is in natural sentences with no weird punctuation like a newspaper article because thats what spacys training data looks like to that end you should remove meaningless white space like newlines leading and trailing spaces or formatting characters maybe a line of but thats about all the cleanup you have to do the spacy training data wont have bullets so they might get some weird results but i would leave them in to start also bullets are obviously printable characters maybe you mean nonascii i have no idea what you mean by muck with the indexes but for some older nlp methods it was common to do more extensive preprocessing like removing stop words and lowercasing everything doing that will make things worse with spacy because it uses the information you are removing for clues just like a human reader would note that you can train your own models in which case theyll learn about the kind of text you show them in that case you can get rid of preprocessing entirely though for actually meaningless things like newlines leading and following spaces you might as well remove them anyway to address your new info briefly yes character indexes for ner labels must be updated if you do preprocessing if they arent updated they arent usable it looks like youre trying to extract skills from a resume that has many bullet point lists the spacy training data is newspaper articles which dont contain any lists like that so its hard to say what the right thing to do is i dont think the bullets matter much but you can try removing or not removing them what about stuff like lowercasing stop words lemmatizing etc i already addressed this but do not do this this was historically common practice for nlp models but for modern neural models including spacy it is actively unhelpful

70085180,is it possible to export and use a spacy ner model without an vocab and inject tokensvectors on the fly,python spacy,in spacy v not v there are some hidden background steps that register the vectors globally under a particular name for use as features in the statistical models the idea behind this is that multiple models in the same process can potentially share the same vectors in ram to get a subset of vectors to work for a particular text you need to register the new vectors under the right name use the same vectorsname as in the model metadata when creating the vectors will be something like encoreweblgvectors run spacymllinkvectorstomodelsvocab im pretty sure that this will start printing warnings and renaming the vectors internally based on the data shape if you do it repeatedly for different sets of vectors with the same name i think you can ignore the warnings and it will work for that individual text but it may break any other models loaded in the same script that are using that same vectors nameshape if you are doing this a lot in practice you might want to write a custom version of linkvectorstomodels that iterates over the words in the vocab more efficiently for very small vector tables or only modifies the words in the vocab that you know that you need it really depends on the size of the vocab at the point where youre running linkvectorstomodels

63079854,how to split a text file into sentences for wordvecgensim,python spacy gensim,the problem is the content of test is processed at once and the intermediate data structures dont fit in memory processing it in chunks should solve the problem for example if sentences are never split between lines gradual processing would look like since sentences can stretch over multiple lines you might want to use a different strategy of splitting test eg by splitting on double newline instead for line in ftestreadsplitnn but most likely even this naive approach will work just fine
62921756,how to assign lexical features to new unanalyzable tokens in spacy,spacy,the tagger and parser are independent the parser doesnt use the tags as features so modifying the tags isnt going to affect the dependency parse the tagger doesnt overwrite any existing tags so if a tag is already set it doesnt modify it the existing tags dont influence its predictions at all though so the surrounding words are tagged the same way they would be otherwise setting tag and pos in the retokenizer is a good way to set those attributes if youre not always retokenizing and you want to set the tag andor pos based on a regular expression for the token text then the best way to do this is a custom pipeline component that you add before the tagger that sets tags for certain words the transitionbased parsing algorithm cant easily deal with partial dependencies in the input so there isnt a straightforward solution here i can think of a few things that might help the parser does respect preset sentence boundaries if your skipped tokens are between sentences you can set tokenissentstart true for that token and the following token so that the skipped token always ends up in its own sentence if the skipped tokens are in the middle of a sentence or you want them to be analyzed as nouns in the sentence then this wont help the parser does use the tokennorm feature so if you set the norm feature in the retokenizer to something extremely propnlike you might have a better chance of getting the intended analysis for example if youre using a provided english model like encorewebsm use a word you think would be a frequent similar proper noun in american newspaper text from years ago so if the skipped token should be like a last name use bush or clinton it wont guarantee a better parse but it could help if you using a model with vectors like encoreweblg you can also set the vectors for the skipped token to be the same as a similar word check that the similar word has a vector first this is how to tell the model to refer to the same row in the vector table for unknownskipped as bush the simpler option that duplicates the vectors in the vector table internally the less elegant version that doesnt duplicate vectors underneath the second line is only necessary to get this to work for a model thats currently loaded if you save it as a custom model after the first line with nlptodisk and reload it then only the first line is necessary if you just have a small set of skipped tokens you could update the parser with some examples containing these tokens but this can be tricky to do well without affecting the accuracy of the parser for other cases the norm and vector modifications will also influence the tagger so its possible if you choose those well you might get pretty close to the results you want

62606163,is it possible to use pipe for batches of tokenized documents in spacy,spacy,theres no way to set up a tokenizerless pipeline in spacy one option is to call each pipeline component individually after creating the docs for pipename in nlppipenames docs nlpgetpipepipenamepipedocs or another equivalent for pipename pipe in nlppipeline docs pipepipedocs if youre not enabling multiprocessing this will be as efficient as using nlppipe because this is also more or less what nlppipe does underneath another alternative is to create your own replacement tokenizer that accepts either liststr or doc inputs and replace nlptokenizer with this custom tokenizer then you can call nlppipe as usual the simplest version of this with liststr input would look like this this example and some related examples and discussion are here
62601020,how to add custom rules to spacy tokenizer to break down html in single tokens,python parsing spacy,one way to achieve this seems to involve making the tokenizer both break up tokens containing a tag without whitespace and lump taglike sequences as single tokens to split up tokens like the one in your example you can modify the tokenizer infixes in the manner described here to ensure tags are regarded as single tokens you can use special cases see the tokenizer overview or the method docs you would add special cases for opened closed and empty tags eg taken together this seems to yield the expected result eg applying will print the tag in its entirety and on its own i found the tokenizers explain method quite helpful in this context it gives you a breakdown of what was tokenized why

62153385,how do i train a pseudoprojective parser on spacy,spacy dependencyparsing,the problem is that the simple training example script isnt projectivitizing the training instances when initializing and training the model the parsing algorithm itself can only handle projective parses but if the parser component finds projectivized labels in its output theyre deprojectivitzed in a postprocessing step you dont need to modify any parser settings so starting with a german model makes no difference just provide projectivized input in the right format the initial projectivization is handled automatically by the train cli which uses goldcorpustraindocs to prepare the training examples for nlpupdate and sets makeprojectivetrue when creating the goldparses in general id recommend switching to the train cli which also requires switching to the internal json training format which is admittedly a minor hassle because the train cli sets a lot of better defaults however a toy example also works fine as long as you create projectivized training examples with goldparsemakeprojectivetrue add all the projectivized dependency labels to the parser and train with doc and the projectivized goldparse input instead of the textannotation input
61778810,can i apply custom token rules to tokens split by prefixes in spacy,python tokenize spacy prefix,unfortunately theres no way to have prefixes and suffixes also analyzed as exceptions in spacy v tokenizer exceptions will be handled more generally in the upcoming spacy v release in order to support cases like this but i dont know when the release might be at this point i think the best you can do in spacy v is to have a quick postprocessing component that assigns the lemmasnorms to the individual tokens if they match the orth pattern

59500498,spacy tokenizer is there a way to use regex as a key in custom exceptions for updateexc,spacy,no theres no way to have regular expressions as tokenizer exceptions the tokenizer only looks for exceptions as exact string matches mainly for reasons of speed the other difficulty for this kind of example is that tokenizer exceptions currently cant contain spaces support for spaces is planned for a future version of spacy but not regexes which would still be too slow i think the best way to do this would be to add a custom pipeline component at the beginning of the pipeline that retokenizes the document with the retokenizer you can provide any required attributes like lemmas while retokenizing
59306586,how to customize tokenizer with complex tokenmatch,python spacy,the tokenizer solution would the same as except that you customize the suffixes its not a great solution though because then isnt a suffix anywhere i think the solution with docretokenize is better for v you can do it in a small custom pipeline component thats added to the beginning of the pipeline it might be better to have two tokenmatch options one with prefixes and suffixes and one without but its not great to make the tokenizer options more complicated than they already are either

57798342,how can i add components before tokenizer in spacy pipline,python spacy,its not possible to add a component before the tokenizer in the pipeline because the tokenizer has a special status as the initial component that takes a string and returns a doc all other components take docs and return docs in general i think it would be best to preprocess your texts outside of spacy however you can create a custom tokenizer that does some preprocessing since all you need is a component that takes a string and returns a doc its pretty easy to modify a pipeline temporarily but its harder to get the modifications integrated enough that it can be saved to disk if you want to save and reload the model this is a minimal version that cant be saved to disk
57678190,is there a fast way to get the tokens for each sentence in spacy,spacy,the main problem with your approach is that youre processing everything twice a sentence in docsents is a span object ie a sequence of tokens so theres no need to call nlp on the sentence text again spacy already does all of this for you under the hood and the doc you get back already includes all information you need so if you need a list of strings one for each token you can do sentencetokens for sent in docsents sentencetokensappendtokentext for token in sent or even shorter sentencetokens tokentext for token in sent for sent in docsents if youre processing a lot of texts you probably also want to use nlppipe to make it more efficient this will process the texts in batches and yield doc objects you can read more about it here texts some text lots and lots of texts for doc in nlppipetexts sentencetokens tokentext for token in sent for sent in docsents do something with the tokens

57206701,spacy tokenizer rule for exceptions that contain whitespace,spacy,as you found tokenizeraddspecialcase doesnt work for handling tokens that contain whitespace thats for adding strings like oclock and or expanding eg dont to do not modifying the prefix suffix and infix rules either by setting them on an existing tokenizer or creating a new tokenizer with custom parameters also doesnt work since those are applied after whitespace splitting to override the whitespace splitting behavior you have four options merge after tokenization you use retokenizermerge or possibly mergeentities or mergenounchunks the relevant documentation is here and and this is your best bet for keeping as much of the default behavior as possible subclass tokenizer and override call sample code implement a completely new tokenizer without subclassing tokenizer relevant docs here tokenize externally and instantiate doc with words relevant docs here to answer the second part of your question if you dont need to change whitespace splitting behavior you have two other options add to the default prefix suffix and infix rules the relevant documentation is here note from you can add new patterns without defining a custom tokenizer but theres no way to remove a pattern without defining a custom tokenizer instantiate tokenizer with custom prefix suffix and infix rules the relevant documentation is here to get the default rules you read the existing tokenizers attributes as shown above or use the nlp objects defaults there are code samples for the latter approach in and
57199811,create a spacy pipeline with my own tokeniser,spacy,the reason the tokenizer isnt part of the regular pipeline is because its special there can only really be one and while all other pipeline components take a doc and return it the tokenizer takes a string of text and turns it into a doc however nlptokenizer is writable so you can either create your own tokenizer class from scratch or even replace it with an entirely custom function heres a super simple example that shows the idea from spacylangen import english from spacytokens import doc nlp english def mytokenizertext tokens textsplit doc docnlpvocab wordstokens return doc nlptokenizer mytokenizer doc nlphello world printtokentext for token in doc hello world
57187116,how to modify spacytokensdocdoc tokens with pipeline components in spacy,pythonx spacy,one of the core principles of spacys doc is that it should always represent the original input spacys tokenization is nondestructive so it always represents the original input text and never adds or deletes anything this is kind of a core principle of the doc object you should always be able to reconstruct and reproduce the original input text while you can work around that there are usually better ways to achieve the same thing without breaking the input text doc text consistency ive outlined some approaches for excluding tokens without destroying the original input in my comment here alternatively if you really want to modify the doc your component could create a new doc object and return that the doc object takes a vocab eg the original docs vocab a list of string words and an optional list of spaces a list of booleans indicating whether the token at that position is followed by a space or not from spacytokens import doc def preprocesstextdoc generate a new list of tokens here newwords createnewwordsheredoc newdoc docdocvocab wordsnewwords return newdoc note that you probably want to add this component first in the pipeline before other components run otherwise youd lose any linguistic features assigned by previous components like partofspeech tags dependencies etc

55852115,token extension versus matcher versus phrase matcher vs entity ruler in spacy,python performance spacy,i think ultimately it all comes down to finding the optimal tradeoff between speed maintainability of the code and the way this piece of logic fits into the larger picture of your application finding a few strings in a text is unlikely to be the end goal of what youre trying to do otherwise you probably wouldnt be using spacy and would stick to regular expressions how your application needs to consume the result of the matching and what the matches mean in the larger context should motivate the approach you choose as you mention in the conclusion if your matches are named entities by definition adding them to the docents makes a lot of sense and will even give you an easy way to combine your logic with statistical predictions even if it adds slightly more overhead itll likely still outperform any scaffolding youd otherwise have to write around it yourself for each solution i start with an initial setup if youre running the experiments in the same session eg in a notebook you may want to include the creation of the doc object in your initial setup otherwise the caching of the vocabulary entries could theoretically mean that the very first call of nlptext is slower than the subsequent calls its likely insignificant though i was quite surprised that the token matcher outperforms the phrase matcher i thought it would be opposite one potential explanation is that youre profiling the approaches on a very small scale and on singletoken patterns where the phrase matcher engine doesnt really have an advantage over the regular token matcher another factor could be that matching on a different attribute eg lower instead of textorth requires creating a new doc during matching that reflects the values of the matched attribute this should be inexpensive but its still one extra object that gets created so a test doc extract january will actually become extract january when matching on lower or even verb propn when matching on pos thats the trick that makes matching on other attributes work some background on how the phrasematcher works and why its mechanism is typically faster when you add doc objects to the phrasematcher it sets flags on the tokens included in the patterns indicating that theyre matching a given pattern it then calls into the regular matcher and adds tokenbased patterns using the previously set flags when youre matching spacy will only have to check the flags and not retrieve any token attributes thats what should make the matching itself significantly faster at scale this actually brings up another approach you could be profiling for comparison using vocabaddflag to set a boolean flag on the respective lexeme entry in the vocab so not the contextsensitive token vocab entries are cached so you should only have to compute the flag once for a lexeme like january however this approach only really makes sense for single tokens so its relatively limiting am i missing something important here or can i trust this analysis on a larger scale if you want to get any meanigful insights you should be benchmarking on at least a mediumsized scale you dont want to be looping over the same small example times and instead benchmark on a dataset that youll only be processing once per test for instance a few hundred documents similar to the data youre actually working with there are caching effects both within spacy but also your cpu differences in memory allocation and so on that can all have an impact finally using spacys cython api directly will always be the fastest so if speed is your number one concern and all you want to optimise for cython would be the way to go
55597688,speed up spacy tokenizer,pythonx spacy,the main problem open your output file once and leave it open until the end of your script repeatedly closing and reopening and seeking to the end of an ever larger text file is going to be extremely slow read the stopwords into an actual set otherwise youre searching for each token in a long string containing the whole file which accidentally matches partial words and is much much slower than checking for set membership use nlppipe or for tokenization just nlptokenizerpipe to speed up the spacy part a bit with a bunch of short onesentence documents this doesnt seem to make a huge difference it is much faster to tokenize one large document rather than treating each line as an individual document but whether you want to do that depends on how your data is structured if youre just tokenizing you can increase the maximum document size nlpmaxlength if you need to
55498881,vectorized form of cleaning function for nlp,python multithreading pandas spacy swifter,short answer this type of problem inherently takes time long answer use regular expressions change the spacy pipeline the more information about the strings you need to make a decision the longer it will take good news is if your cleaning of the text is relatively simplified a few regular expressions might do the trick otherwise you are using the spacy pipeline to help remove bits of text which is costly since it does many things by default tokenisation lemmatisation dependency parsing ner chunking alternatively you can try your task again and turn off the aspects of the spacy pipeline you dont want which may speed it up quite a bit for example maybe turn off named entity recognition tagging and dependency parsing then try again it will speed up

52799113,iterating over tokens within lists within lists using forloops in python spacy,python forloop spacy,below is the code for iterating over elements of nested lists i think that your misunderstanding comes from the fact that each sentence in spacy is not stored in a list but in a doc object the doc object is iterable and contains the tokens but some extra information too example code the outputs are identical hope it helps

50688402,spacy adding pointer to another token in custom component,pointers token spacy,the token object is only a view its sort of like holding a reference to the doc object and an index to the token the span object is like this too this ensures theres a single source of truth and only one copy of the data you can find the definition of the key structs in the spacystructspxd file this defines the attributes of the tokenc struct the doc object then holds an array of these and a length the token objects are created on the fly when you index into the doc the data definition for the doc object can be found in spacytokensdocpxd and the implementation of the token access is in spacytokensdocpyx the way the parse tree is encoded in spacy is a bit unsatisfying ive made an issue about this on the tracker it feels like there should be a better solution what we do is encode the offset of the head relative to the token so if you do docci doccihead youll get a pointer to the head that part is okay the part thats a bit weirder is that we track the left and right edges of the tokens subtree and the number of direct left and right children to get the rightmost or leftmost child we navigate around within this region in practice this actually works pretty well because were dealing with a contiguous block of memory and loops in cython are fast but it still feels a bit janky as far as what youll be able to do as a userif you run your own fork of spacy you can happily define your own data on the structs but then youre running your own fork theres no way to attach real attributes to the doc or token objects as these are defined as clevel types so their structure is defined statically its not dynamic you could subclass the doc but this is quite ugly you need to also subclass this is why we have the underscore attributes and the docuserdata dictionary its really the only way to extend the objects fortunately you shouldnt really face a data redundancy problem nothing is stored on the token objects the definitions of your extensions are stored globally within the underscore class data is stored on the doc object even if it applies to a token again the token is a view it cant own anything so the doc has to note that we have some value assigned to token i if youre defining a treenavigation system id recommend considering defining it as your own cython class so you can use structs if you use native python types itll be pretty slow and pretty large if you pack the data into numpy arrays the representation will be more compact but writing the code will be a pretty miserable experience and the performance is likely to be not great in short define your own types in cython put the data into a struct owned by a cdef class and give the class accessor methods use the underscore attributes to access the data from spacys doc span and token objects if you come up with a compelling api for srl and the data can be coded compactly into the tokenc struct wed consider adding it as native support

48572541,spacy sentence tokenization error on hebrew,python spacy,spacys hebrew coverage is currently quite minimal it currently only has word tokenization for hebrew which roughly splits on white space with some extra rules and exceptions the sentence tokenizationboundary detection that you want requires a more sophisticated grammatical parsing of the sentence in order to determine where one sentence ends and another begins these models require a large amount of labeled training data so are available for a smaller number of languages than have tokenization heres the list the initial message is telling you that it can do tokenization which doesnt require a model and then the error youre getting is the result of not having a model to split sentences do ner or pos etc you might look at this list for other resources for hebrew nlp if you find enough labeled data in the right format and youre feeling ambitious you could train your own hebrew spacy model using the overview described here

47862971,rasa nlu parse not give currect intent give same intent in result,python botframework chatbot spacy rasanlu,the general recommendation when rasa nlu seems to be functioning correctly but incorrectly classifying intents and entities is add more training data so try that but also try these other suggestions rasa recently released the tensorflow embeddings pipeline this pipeline creates a small language model with the training data set and word vectors it can in general can operate on a more modest data set set your pipeline in configyml to tensorflowembedding to give it a try use the evaluate script to see where your training data is the weakest the script will generate f scores and a chart for showing which intents are being misclassified the most increase the size of your spacy model without information on the language you are using or the spacy model you have installed this is just a shot in the dark but especially if you have installed the small spacy model for english encorewebsm you should try the medium or large size models which include word vectors with all that said my experience with dialogflow and rasa nlu both suggest more training data is required for rasas implementation also if you continue to have problems join us on the rasa nlu gitter and we can help you there

47396158,spacy says dependency parser not loaded,spacy,i think the problem here is quite simple when you call this spacy will load the english language class containing the language data and specialcase rules but no model data and weights which enable the parser tagger and entity recognizer to make predictions this is by design because spacy has no way of knowing if you want to load in model data and if so which package so if you want to load an english model youll have to use spacyload which will take care of loading the data and putting together the language and processing pipeline under the hood spacyload will look for an installed model package called encorewebsm load it and check the models meta data to determine which language the model needs in this case english and which pipeline it supports in this case tagger parser and ner it then initialises an instance of english creates the pipeline loads in the binary data from the model package and returns the object so you can call it on your text see this section for a more detailed explanation of this

43388476,how could spacy tokenize hashtag as a whole,python tokenize spacy hashtag,i also tried several ways to prevent spacy from splitting hashtags or words with hyphens like cuttingedge my experience is that merging tokens afterwards can be problematic because the pos tagger and dependency parsers already used the wrong tokens for their decisions touching the infix prefix suffix regexps is kind of error prone complex because you dont want to produce side effects by your changes the simplest way is indeed as pointed out by before to modify the tokenmatch function of the tokenizer this is a rematch identifying regular expressions that will not be split instead of importing the speficic url pattern id rather extend whatever spacys default is this yields

78621519,how to parse search engine keywords input,python parsing operators nltk,i would use ply python lexyacc or sly to parse it ply and sly have the same author but ply uses functions and sly uses classes i took example calcpy from sly and created code which converts query like to nested list which should be easy to use to generate sql query other examples abcd or and a b and not c d i changed text so it can catch a b c as one string without using and if you use a b c then it returns it as one string without but it allows to use inside text if there is no at the beginning and at the end abc f g h i j k and and abc f g h i j k but it doesnt allow to use chars inside text it would need some changes in text and in functions ab and a b i added as not because python uses as not equal so i was writing automatically in query as not because i often use it in pandas for negations so sometimes i was writing automatically in query here version with more modifications original version converts a b c d to and and and a b c d and new version can use function flatten to create and a b c d if you send flat or notflat as query then it switch variable flatten which decide if it should use flatten i also added function which tries to convert it to sql query with var like text and for list and a b c d it gives string so you have to only replace var with your variable but i dont know if i should add automatically or user should ask a b because it allows to check if text starts with a and ends with b eventually user could use a b c and code should convert it to a and b and c add automatically if there is no at both sides i added also function which saves history in file and read it at next start i added also json to display data as and a or b c d not x i added function history and shortcut h to see history i also added function to select field like dayhday titlehello which gives day like hday and title like hello notflat flat

61719008,how can i parse a text from an url and put the clean text in a dataframe,python pandas beautifulsoup nltk,firstly most news site has an rss feed for the wwthestarcom site theres instead of parsing urls from an excel sheet its much more convenient to parse the rss feed lets try the toronto news from to get the data from a website one can use the requests library in code to parse the xml file lets use the feedparser library now lets try to fetch the text from each of the link from the rss using beautifulsoup and from the beautifulsoup object there is a nifty gettext function that we can use to extract the text sometimes this can get somewhat noisy since you already did the hard work for finding the carticlebodycontent tag that you need to extract the articles main text we can get the text from thats all nice the explanation and all but you havent told me how to put them into a dataframe now the question is why do you need the dataframe if you only need some keyword tokens per url then we have to do some processing lets first define the steps needed for preprocessing to get our keywords now there are several options we can use scikitlearn withnltk to do and see but lets keep it simple and just use nltk for now since the nltkwordtokenize function implicitly calls senttokenize we can just call wordtokenize so just and would do for now lets simply use nltkcorpusstopwords as stopwords for so we have this preprocess function hey i said thats all nice and all but i really want a dataframe okay okay theres dataframe but btw theres pandasdataframe is not the only dataframe library in python see alright alright heres pandas first we have the urltotext dictionary that have the urls as keys and the text from the article as values and lets say we want a dataframe where it keys a the url b the text in the article c the resulting tokens from the cleaned text so heres a dataframe with a and b out nice how about the cleaned tokens since we have a dataframe to work with and function that we want to apply to all the values in the text column we just need to use dataframeapply ie awesome wait a minute did you just do a quotation mark on the cleaned text yes i did because what is clean see why do we need to clean the text do we really need to clean the text what is the ultimate goal of preprocessing the text i guess the above questions are out of scope of the original post op so gonna leave them as food for thoughts for you have fun with the code above

55492666,what is better to use keraspreprocessingtokenizer or nltktokenize,python keras nltk tokenize,by default they both use some regular expression based tokenisation the difference lies in their complexity keras tokenizer just replaces certain punctuation characters and splits on the remaining space character nltk tokenizer uses the treebank tokenizer uses regular expressions to tokenize text as in penn treebank this implementation is a port of the tokenizer sed script written by robert mcintyre and available at they are both very fast since they just run regular expressions if you have very basic text with not too much punctuation or out of order characters then keras might be the simplest choice if you actually want a neural network based one that can parse numbers dates etc correctly and potentially perform partofspeech tagging entity recognition you can use stanford corenlp that gives a full pipeline for processing text finding dependencies recognising entitites etc spacy is also a full python nlp pipeline that gives you similar results as well a loading corresponding word vectors such as glove the above two are slower than any regular expression based methods but it depends on the source text you want to process
55433491,split sentences process words and put sentence back together,python text split nltk sentence,so basically you want to attribute a score for each word the function you give may be improved using a dictionary instead of several if statements also you have to return all scores instead of just the score of the first wordin wordstoworkwith which is the current behavior of the function since it will return an integer on the first iteration so the new function would be for the second part which is reconstructing the string i would actually do this in the same function so this answers your second question im not guaranteeing this code will work at first try i cant test it but itll give you the main idea

52916729,why tokenizepreprocess words for language analysis,python nltk tweepy analysis,this approach is needed in order to be able to tell which word accounts for which dimension in the vector that numerically represents the string also it sometimes uses additional editing like lowercasing words and removing punctuation marks lets take a look at the following example the sentence first is split into a list and the symbols as well as are removed and it is made sure that the strings are lowercase next up is counting the words via counter you can interpret this result as a vector with representing is the word just and so on if your dictionary is getting bigger because you are utilizing a much bigger corpus the vectors get increasingly sparse which means that they contain more and more zeros and the information contained within can be stored in a more compressed way if you therefore have a sentence that you want to represent numerically it is needed to first create a dictionary of your corpus like done above with a single sentence so you can tell which word represents which dimension you can try to represent the data above in a semistructured data format like json but will see that this is in itself not a well compressed representation of your data this approach could be combined with uncompressing the data before loading or after saving but this would incur a performance penalty multiple times while building a dictionary would have only onetime costs

52150000,how to train nltk punktsentencetokenizer batchwise,python nltk nltktrainer,i found this question after running into this problem myself i figured out how to train the tokenizer batchwise and am leaving this answer for anyone else looking to do this i was able to train a punktsentencetokenizer on roughly gb of biomedical text content in around hours with a memory footprint no greater than gb at a time nevertheless id like to second colidyres recommendation to prefer other tools over the punktsentencetokenizer in most situations there is a class punkttrainer you can use to train the punktsentencetokenizer in a batchwise fashion suppose we have a generator that yields a stream of training texts in my case each iteration of the generator queries a database for texts at a time then yields all of these texts concatenated together we can instantiate a punkttrainer and then begin training notice the call to the freqthreshold method after processing each text this reduces the memory footprint by cleaning up information about rare tokens that are unlikely to influence future training once this is complete call the finalize training method then you can instantiate a new tokenizer using the parameters found during training colidyre recommended using spacy with added abbreviations however it can be difficult to know which abbreviations will appear in you text domain in advance to get the best of both worlds you can add the abbreviations found by punkt you can get a set of these abbreviations in the following way

50431155,whats the tags meaning of stanford dependency parser,nltk stanfordnlp,for the last few versions the stanford parser has been generating universal dependencies rather than stanford dependencies the new relation set can be found here and are listed below for version version seems to be a workinprogress still although no longer maintained you can get the old dependency format by setting the property depparselanguage to english see eg here
50240029,nltk wordpuncttokenize vs wordtokenize,python nltk,wordpuncttokenize is based on a simple regexp tokenization it is defined as which you can find here basically it uses the regular expression wws to split the input wordtokenize on the other hand is based on a treebankwordtokenizer see the docs here it basically tokenizes text like in the penn treebank here is a silly example that should show how the two differ as we can see wordpuncttokenize will split pretty much at all special symbols and treat them as separate units wordtokenize on the other hand keeps things like re together it doesnt seem to be all that smart though since as we can see it fails to separate the initial single quote from hey interestingly if we write the sentence like this instead single quotes as string delimiter and double quotes around hey we get so wordtokenize does split off double quotes however it also converts them to and wordpuncttokenize doesnt do this

49499770,nltk word tokenizer treats ending single quote as a separate word,python nltk,seems like its a not a bug but the expected output from nltkwordtokenize this is consistent with the treebank word tokenizer from robert mcintyre tokenizersed as prateek pointed out you can try other tokenizers that might suit your needs the more interesting question is why does the starting single quote stick to a the following character couldnt we hack the treebankwordtokenizer like what was done at out yes the modification would work for the string in the op but itll start to break all the clitics eg note that the original nltkwordtokenize keeps the starting single quotes to the clitics and outputs this instead there are strategies to handle the ending quotes but not the starting quotes after a clitics at but the main reason for this problem is because the word tokenizer doesnt have a sense of balancing the quotations mark if we look at the mosestokenizer there are a lot more mechanisms to handle quotes interestingly stanford corenlp doesnt do that in terminal python looks like theres some sort of regex hack put in to recognizecorrect the english clitics if we do some reverse engineering its possible to add a regex to patch wordtokenize eg so we can do something like out

46096363,nltk reconstruct sentence from tokens,nltk,the nltk provides no such function whitespace is thrown away during tokenization so there is no way to get back exactly what you started with the whitespace might have included newlines and multiple spaces and theres no way to get these back the best you can do is to join the sentence into a string that looks like a normal sentence a simple jointokens will put a space before and after all punctuation which looks odd so you need to get rid of spaces before most punctuation except for a select few like and that should have the space after them removed even then its sometimes guesswork since the apostrophe is sometimes used between words sometimes before and sometimes after nuthin doin yall my recommendation is to hold on to the original strings from which you tokenized the sentence and go back to those you dont show where your sentences come from so theres nothing more to say really edit april in the meantime the nltk provides the following method for turning a list of tokens into a normally punctuated sentence note that you still cant count on getting exactly what you started with

45919639,improving the performance of text cleanup on a dataframe,python performance pandas nltk apply,the first obvious point of improvement i see here is that the entire getwordnetpos function should be reducible to a dictionary lookup instead of this initialise a defaultdict from the collections package you will then access the lookup like this next you could consider precompiling your regex pattern if it is to be used in multiple places the speedup you get isnt as much but it all matters inside your function youd call otoh if you are aware of where your text is coming from and have some idea of what you might and might not see you can precompile a list of characters and instead use strtranslate which is much much faster than a clunky regex based substitution furthermore id say wordtokenize is overkill what you do is get rid of special characters anyway so you lose all the benefits of wordtokenize which really makes a difference with punctuation and the like you could just choose to fall back on textsplit finally skip the clean jointokenslemmatized step just return the list and then call dfapplymap join in the final step i leave the benchmarking to you

45425946,tokenize in nltktweettokenizer returning integers by splitting,python nltk tokenize,tldr it seems to be a bugfeature of the tweettokenizer which were unsure what motivates this read on to find out where the bugfeature occurs in long looking at the tokenize function in tweettokenizer before the actual tokenizing the tokenizer does some preprocessing first it remove entities from text by converting them to their corresponding unicode character through the replacehtmlentities function optionally it removes username handles using the removehandles function optionally it normalize the word length through the reducelengthening function then shortens the problematic sequences of characters using the hangre regex lastly the actual tokenization takes place through the wordre regex after the wordre regex it optionally preserve the case of emoticons before lowercasing the tokenized output in code by default the handle stripping and length reduction doesnt kick in unless specified by user lets go through the steps and regexes checked replacehtmlentities isnt the culprit by default removehandles and reducelengthening is skipped but for sanity sake lets see checked too neither of the optional functions are behaving badly klar the hangre is cleared of its name too achso thats where the splits appear now lets look deeper into the wordre its a tuple of regexes the first is a massive url pattern regex from lets go through them one by one ah ha it seems like the nd regex from regexps is causing the problem if we look at the second regex from regexp tries to parse numbers as phonenumbers the pattern tries to recognize optionally the first digits will be matched as international code the next digits as the area code optionally followed by a dash then more digits which is the telecom exchange code another optional dash lastly digit base phone number see for a detailed explanation thats why its trying to split contiguous digits up into digits block but note the quirks since the phone number regex is hard coded it is possible to catch real phone numbers in the ddd or d patterns but if the dashes are in other order it wont work can we fix it see
44915026,how to merge two punktsentencetokenizer pickle files,python nltk pickle tokenize textsegmentation,you cant merge two pickle files pickling is just a file serialization format so what you can do with the contents is entirely dependent on the structure of the objects you pickled in your case you seem to assume that the unpickled objects are dictionaries but in fact they are punktsentencetokenizer objects including their internal frequency tables that accounts for the typeerror the only viable option would be to study the internals of the punktsentencetokenizer and find out what needs to be merged and whether there is even any meaningful sense of merging two models but for your apparent intended use i recommend simply concatenating your custom training corpus to a large corpus of normallypunctuated english eg the gutenberg corpus or any other collection of plaintext files and training a single sentence detection model on the combined data

37958781,which tokenizer is better to be used with nltk,python nltk tokenize,looking at the source code for senttokenize reveals that this method currently uses the pretrained punkt tokenizer so it is the equivalent to punktsentencetokenizer whether or not you will need to retrain your tokenizer depends on the nature of the text you are working with if it is nothing too exotic like newspaper articles then you will likely find the pretrained tokenizer to be sufficient tokenizing boils down to a categorization task and thus different tokenizers could be compared by using the typical metrics such as precision recall fscore etc on labelled data the punkt tokenizer is based on the work published in the following paper it is fundamentally a heuristic based approach geared to disambiguating sentence boundaries from abbreviations the bane of sentence tokenization calling it a heuristic approach is not meant to be disparaging i have used the builtin sentence tokenizer before and it worked fine for what i was doing of course my task did not really depend on accurate sentence tokenizing or rather i was able to throw enough data at it where it did not really matter here is an example of a question on so where a user found the pretrained tokenizer lacking and needed to train a new one how to tweak the nltk sentence tokenizer the text in question was moby dick and the odd sentence structure was tripping up the tokenizer some examples of where you might need to train your own tokenizer are social media eg twitter or technical literature with lots of strange abbreviations not encountered by the pretrained tokenizer

37187500,nltk sentence tokenizer gives attributeerror,python pythonx nltk tokenize textmining,the line thats giving you trouble is correct thats how youre supposed to use the sentence tokenizer with a single string as its argument youre getting an error because you have created a monster the punkt sentence tokenizer is based on an unsupervised algorithm you give it a long text and it figures out where the sentence boundaries must lie but you have trained your tokenizer with a list of sentences the first elements in commentslist which is incorrect somehow the tokenizer doesnt notice and gives you something that errors out when you try to use it properly to fix the problem train your tokenizer with a single string you can best join a list of strings into one like this ps you must be wrong about it working successfully when you tokenized a literal string certainly there were other differences between the code that worked and the code in your question
37157822,applying nltkfreqdist after splitting a csv,python csv nltk frequencydistribution,you seem to be missing a couple of steps along the way sir when you iterate over the rows in the file splitting them by your result is actually a sequence of lists what i think you want correct me if im wrong is to stitch these lists into one big one so that you can count frequencies of items in the whole file you can do this with something like the following now that you have all your words in one list you can count their frequencies based on the output data you describe i actually think nltkfreqdist is overkill for this and you should be just fine with collectionscounter note that since freqdist inherits from counter you can easily substitute it in the snippet above in case you still really want to use it if youre using python counteritems returns an iterator not a list so you have to explicitly convert it et viola you have your tokens paired up with their respective counts one final note you may have to call strstrip on your tokens because i dont think splitting by will remove the whitespace between the words and the delimiters but that depends on what your real data looks like and whether you want to take spaces into account or no

27243658,nltk sentence tokenizer incorrect,nltk,firstly the senttokenize function uses the punkt tokenizer that was used to tokenize wellformed english sentence so by including the correct capitalization would have resolve your problem now lets dig deeper the punkt tokenizer is an algorithm by kiss and strunk see for the implementation this tokenizer divides a text into a list of sentences by using an unsupervised algorithm to build a model for abbreviation words collocations and words that start sentences it must be trained on a large collection of plaintext in the target language before it can be used so in the case of senttokenize im quite sure its train on a wellformed english corpus hence the fact that capitalization after a fullstop is a strong indication of sentence boundary and fullstop itself might not be since we have things like ie eg and in some cases the corpus might have things like put pasta in pot n fill the pot with water with such sentencedocuments in the training data it is very likely that the algorithm thinks that fullstop following a noncaptalized word is not a sentence boundary so to resolve the problem i suggest the following manually segment of your sentences and the retrain a corpus specific tokenizer convert your corpus into wellformed orthography before using senttokenize see also training data format for nltk punkt

13035595,tokenization of arabic words using nltk,python tokenize nltk,i always recommend using nltktokenizewordpuncttokenize you can try out many of the nltk tokenizers at and see for yourself
12599550,open and preprocessing file in python nltk,python regex nltk,i think you want to use the read method to read all the file contents into a string first
9853227,tokenizing large mb txt file using python nltk concatenation write data to stream errors,python nltk tokenize,problem n you are iterating the file char by char like that if you want to read every line efficiently simply open the file dont read it and iterate over filereadlines as follows problem n the wordtokenize function returns a list of tokens so you were trying to sum a str to a list of tokens you first have to transform the list into a string and then you can sum it to another string im going to use the join function to do that replace the comma in my code with the char you want to use as glueseparator if instead you need the tokens in a list simply do hope that helps
9524553,nltk maltparser wont parse,java python parsing nltk,iam not sure if the problem is still unsolved but i think its already solved but as i had the same problems a while ago i would like to share my knowledge first of all the maltparserjar does not accept a connl file with a direct path to its file in front of it like seen above why it is so i do not know but you can easily fix it by changing the command line to something like this here now the directory of the conll file is set using the w parameter using this you can load any conll file from any given folder i also change from tempfilegettempdir to selfworkingdir because in the original nltk version always the tmp folder is set as working directory even if you initialise the maltparser with another working directory i hope this informations will help someone another thing if you want to parse many sentences as once but each individually and not depending on all other sentences you have to add a blank line in the inputconll file and start the numeration for each sentence again with
9228202,tokenizing unicode using nltk,python unicode nltk tokenize,its more likely that the ufeff char is part of the content read from the file i doubt it was inserted by the tokeniser ufeff at the beginning of a file is a deprecated form of byte order mark if it appears anywhere else then it is treated as a zero width nonbreak space was the file written by microsoft notepad from the codecs module docs to increase the reliability with which a utf encoding can be detected microsoft invented a variant of utf that python calls utfsig for its notepad program before any of the unicode characters is written to the file a utf encoded bom which looks like this as a byte sequence xef xbb xbf is written try reading your file using codecsopen instead note the utfsig encoding which consumes the bom experiment

3703944,creating a python function that opens a textfile reads it tokenizes it and finally runs from the command line or as a module,python nltk,error executing openbookpy for the first error you are opening the file twice calling both file and open is redundant they both do the same thing pick one or the other preferably open open openname mode buffering file object open a file using the file type returns a file object this is the preferred way to open a file error importing openbook module for the second error you need to add the module name or import the openbook function into the global namespace
76955663,how to skip tokenization and translation of custom glossary in huggingface nmt models,python huggingfacetransformers huggingfacetokenizers machinetranslation seqseq,constraining beam search or sampling from a generative model is difficult because even when you know what string you want to have in the target sentence you do not know what position it should be depending on the language it may also happen that several inflected forms of the term are possible so you want to allow all of them in the output huggingface transformers have some tools that allow enforcing particular phrases beam search and chaining them into disjunctive conditions which should be all you need however it is limited to fixed sequences of tokens and the decoding might be pretty slow especially the phrasalconstraint class should be useful in this case

63616301,using contextfree grammar to parse options spread order strings,parsing translation transformation textprocessing contextfreegrammar,its a little hard to tell from only examples but my guess is using a contextfree grammar especially if you have almost no experience with them is probably overkill the grammar itself would probably be simple enough but you would need to either add actions to transform the recognized input into the desired output or have the parser build a syntaxtree and then write code to extract the data from the tree and generate the desired output it would be simpler to use regular expressions with capturing for instance heres some python code that pretty much handles your examples its not perfect because the problem isnt perfectly specified eg its unclear what causes the human readable format to have a positive debit vs a negative credit and the space of inputs is no doubt larger than the regex currently handles the point is just to show that based on the examples given regular expressions could be a compact solution to the general problem

29785412,how do i read and parse a text file with numbers fast in c,c performance parsing readfile textprocessing,some suggestions a consider converting or preprocessing the file into a binary format with the aim to minimise the file size and also drastically reduce the cost of parsing i dont know the ranges for your values but various techniques eg using one bit to tell if the number is small or large and storing the number as either a bit integer or a bit integer could halve the file io and double the speed of reading the file from disk and slash parsing costs down to almost nothing note for maximum effect youd modify whatever software created the file in the first place b reading the entire file into memory before you parse it is a mistake it doubles the amount of ram required and the cost of allocatingfreeing and has disadvantages for cpu caches instead read a small amount of the file eg kib and process it then read the next piece and process it and so on so that youre constantly reusing the same small buffer memory c use parallelism for file io it shouldnt be hard to read the next piece of the file while youre processing the previous piece of the file either by using threads or by using asynchronous io d preallocate memory for the neighbour structures and remove mostall malloc calls from your loop the best possible case is to use a statically allocated array as a pool eg neighbor mypoolmaxneighbors where malloc can be replaced with mypoolnextentry this reducesremoves the overhead of malloc while also improving cache locality for the data itself e use parallelism for storing values for example you could have multiple threads where the first thread handles all the cases where rootlevel numthreads the second thread handles all cases where rootlevel numthreads etc with all of the above assuming a modern core cpu i think you can get the total time for reading and storing down to less than seconds

29137914,r split function size increase issue,r memory textprocessing categoricaldata logfileanalysis,try this what happenned in your case is that since the id was numerical the number was used as an index position in the created list which is obviously not right since ids go pretty high in numbers r filled the gaps with as many empty lists hence the huge object size by making the id a character variable we avoid this another way which would leave the id variable intact inside the line dataframes would be to access the elements in the newly created list youll need to quote the numbers if you use the operator another option would be to add characters in front of the numerical id for instance which makes accessing listitems more convenient

3365365,fast text preprocessing,c regex textprocessing,iteratively replacing words is going to be the biggest bottleneck in your implementation on each iteration you have to scan the entire string for the stopword then the replace operation has to allocate a new string and populate it with the text postreplacement thats not going to be fast a much more efficient approach is to tokenize the string and perform replacement in a streaming fashion divide the input into individual words separated by whatever whitespace or separator characters are appropriate you can do this incrementally so you dont need to allocate any additional memory to do so for each word token you can now perform a lookup in a hashset of stopwords if you find match you will replace it as you stream out the final text to a separate stringbuilder if the token is not a stopword just stream it out the stringbuilder unmodified this approach should have on performance as it only scans the string once and uses a hashset to perform stopword lookup below is one approach that i would expect to perform better while it isnt fully streaming it uses stringsplit which allocated an array of additional strings it does all of the processing in a single pass refining the code to avoid allocating additional string is probably not going to provide much of an improvement since you still need to extract out substrings to perform comparisons to your stopwords code below returns a list of words that excludes all stopwords and words two letters or shorter form the result it uses caseinsensitive comparison on the stopwords as well

2421176,log parseranalyzer in unix,unix parsing textprocessing,i find it to be a huge failure that many log formats do not separate columns with proper unique field separators not because that is best but because it is the basic premise of unix textutils that operate on table data instead they tend to use spaces as separators and quote fields that might contain spaces one of the most practical simple changes i made to web log analyzing was to leave the default ncsa log format produced by the nginx web server to instead use tab as the field separator suddenly i could use all of the primitive unix textutils for quick lookups but especially awk print only lines where the useragent field contains googlebot find the number of requests on for each unique request and of course lots of combinations to find specific visitors

29919779,text preprocessing in sparkscala,scala text apachespark preprocessor textmining,anything is possible the question is what your preferred way of doing this would be for example do you have a stop word dictionary that works for you it could just simply be a set or would you want to run tfidf to automatically pick the stop words note that this would require some supervision such as picking the threshold at which the word would be considered a stop word you can provide the dictionary and sparks mllib already comes with tfidf the pos tags step is tricky most nlp libraries on the jvm eg stanford corenlp dont implement javaioserializable but you can perform the map step using them eg on the other hand dont emit an rdd that contains nonserializable classes from that nlp library since steps such as collect saveasnewapihadoopfile etc will fail also to reduce headaches with serialization use kryo instead of the default java serialization there are numerous posts about this issue if you google around but see here and here once you figure out the serialization issues you need to figure out which nlp library to use to generate the pos tags there are plenty of those eg stanford corenlp lingpipe and mallet for java epic for scala etc note that you can of course use the java nlp libraries with scala including with wrappers such as the university of arizonas sista wrapper around stanford corenlp etc also why didnt your example lowercase the processed text thats pretty much the first thing i would do if you have special cases such as ipod you could apply the lowercasing except in those cases in general though i would lowercase everything if youre removing punctuation you should probably first split the text into sentences split on the period using regex etc if youre removing punctuation in general that can of course be done using regex how deeply do you want to stem for example the porter stemmer there are implementations in every nlp library stems so deeply that universe and university become the same resulting stem do you really want that there are less aggressive stemmers out there depending on your use case also why use stemming if you can use lemmatization ie splitting the word into the grammatical prefix root and suffix eg walked walk root ed suffix the roots would then give you better results than stems in most cases most nlp libraries that i mentioned above do that also whats your distinction between a stop word and a nonuseful word for example you removed the pronoun in the subject form i and the possessive form my but not the object form me i recommend picking up an nlp textbook like speech and language processing by jurafsky and martin for the ambitious or just reading the one of the engineeringcentered books about nlp tools such as lingpipe for java nltk for python etc to get a good overview of the terminology the steps in an nlp pipeline etc

72214408,why does huggingface t tokenizer ignore some of the whitespaces,huggingfacetransformers huggingfacetokenizers sentencepiece,the behaviour is explained by how the tokenize method in ttokenizer strips tokens by default what one can do is adding the token n as a special token to the tokenizer because the special tokens are never seperated it works as expected it is a bit hacky but seems to work then it tokenizes the n without skipping any occurences note that addedtoken is important because somehow the following does not work edit after spending more time on it i actually found a way to add it as a normal token without using special tokens the main reason for the issue is the normalization process that happens behind the scenes even before the tokenization when you add a new token you can specify if it should be normalized or not by setting normalize to false you avoid the tokenizer from stripping consecutive occurrences of the added token you can find more information on this link

63845748,train model with token features,huggingfacetransformers,models in the huggingfaces transformers do not support factored inputs by default as a workaround you can embed the inputs yourself and bypass the embedding layer in bert instead of providing the inputids when you call the model you can provide inputembeds it will use the provided embeddings and the position embeddings to them note that the provided embeddings need to have the same dimension as the rest of the model you need to have one embedding layer per input type lemma gender number voice which also means having factorspecific vocabularies that will assign indices to the inputs that are used for the embedding lookup it makes sense to have a larger embedding for lemmas than for the grammatical categories that have several possible values then you just concatenate the embeddings optionally project them and feed them as inputembeds to the model

62422590,do i need to pretokenize the text first before using huggingfaces robertatokenizer different undersanding,huggingfacetransformers huggingfacetokenizers,hugingfaces transformers are designed such that you are not supposed to do any pretokenization roberta uses sentecepiece which has lossless pretokenization ie when you have a tokenized text you should always be able to say how the text looked like before tokenization the which is a weird unicode underscore in the original sentecepiece says that there should be a space when you detokenize as a consequence big and big end up as different tokens of course in this particular context it does not make much sense because it is obviously still the same word but this the price you pay for lossless tokenization and also how roberta was trained bert uses wordpiece which does not suffer from this problem on the other hand the mapping between the original string and the tokenized text is not as straightforward which might be inconvenient eg when you want to highlight something in a usergenerated text

61708486,whats difference between tokenizerencode and tokenizerencodeplus in hugging face,huggingfacetransformers,the main difference is stemming from the additional information that encodeplus is providing if you read the documentation on the respective functions then there is a slight difference forencode converts a string in a sequence of ids integer using the tokenizer and vocabulary same as doing selfconverttokenstoidsselftokenizetext and the description of encodeplus returns a dictionary containing the encoded sequence or sequence pair and additional information the mask for sequence classification and the overflowing elements if a maxlength is specified depending on your specified model and input sentence the difference lies in the additionally encoded information specifically the input mask since you are feeding in two sentences at a time bert and likely other model variants expect some form of masking which allows the model to discern between the two sequences see here since encodeplus is providing this information but encode isnt you get different output results
61707371,about getspecialtokensmask in huggingfacetransformers,tokenize huggingfacetransformers,you are indeed correct i tested this for both transformers and the at the time of writing current release of and in both cases i do get the inverted results for regular characters and for the special characters for reference this is how i tested it import transformers tokenizer transformersautotokenizerfrompretrainedrobertabase sentence this is a special sentence encodedsentence tokenizerencodesentence specialmasks tokenizergetspecialtokensmaskencodedsentence i would suggest you report this issue in their repository or ideally provide a pull request yourself to fix the issue

61465223,roberta tokenization of multiple sequences,huggingfacetransformers,as with many other questions this can probably be best answered by because it has been pretrained that way the main benefit of models in the transformer family is the insane amount of pretraining that goes into them unless you are willing to replicate the weeksmonths of that pretraining stage i think it is best to accept the feature as it comes related to this it also implies that your suggested approach of feeding in more than two sentences at a time probably wont work see this related issue since roberta is not trained to accept input of more than two sentences it might not work without having a very large pretraining dataset i think for more implementationspecific details you should probably also head over to the huggingface issue tracker itself this sounds like a promising feature that others might be interested to work onuse for themselves but keep in mind that the token limit stays the same and tokens is not much for three or more sentences
61452697,how to use bertforsequenceclassification for token maxlength set at,huggingfacetransformers,unless you are training on a tpu your chances are extremely low of ever having enough gpu ram with any of the available gpus right now for some bert models the model alone takes well above gb in ram and a doubling in sequence length beyond tokens takes about that much more in memory for reference a titan rtx with gb gpu ram most of what is currently available for a single gpu can barely fit samples of tokens in length at the same time fortunately most of the networks still yield a very decent performance when truncating the samples but this is of course taskspecific also keep in mind that unless you are training from scratch all of the pretrained models are generally trained on token limits to my knowledge the only model currently supporting longer sequences is bart which allows up to tokens in length

59435020,get probability of multitoken word in mask position,python pytorch transformermodel bertlanguagemodel huggingfacetransformers,since the split word is not present in the dictionary bert is simply unaware of its probability so there is no use of masking it before tokenization and you cant get its probability by exploiting the rule of chain see response by jdevlin to illustrate it lets take a more generic example try to estimate the probability of some bigram in position i while you can estimate the probability of each word given the sentence and their positions pwiw w wi wi wn pwiw w wi wi wn there is no way to get the probability of the bigram pwiwiw w wi wi wn because bert does not store such information having said all that you can get a very rough estimate of the probability of your oov word by multiplying probabilities of seeing its parts so you will get preprimand prepprimpand since your subwords are not regular words but a special kind of words this is not all wrong because the dependency between them is implicit

63166479,valueerror is only supported for tensors or numpy arrays found keraspreprocessingsequencetimeseriesgenerator object,python tensorflow keras lstm,your first intution is right that you cant use the validationsplit when using dataset generator you will have to understand how the functioninig of dataset generator happens the modelfit api does not know how many records or batch your dataset has in its first epoch as the data is generated or supplied for each batch one at a time to the model for training so there is no way to for the api to know how many records are initially there and then making a validation set out of it due to this reason you cannot use the validationsplit when using dataset generator you can read it in their documentation float between and fraction of the training data to be used as validation data the model will set apart this fraction of the training data will not train on it and will evaluate the loss and any model metrics on this data at the end of each epoch the validation data is selected from the last samples in the x and y data provided before shuffling this argument is not supported when x is a dataset generator or kerasutilssequence instance you need to read the last two lines where they have said that it is not supported for dataset generator what you can instead do is use the following code to split the dataset you can read in detail here i am just writing the important part from the link below i hope my answer helps you

46330073,correct way to split data to batches for keras stateful rnns,machinelearning deeplearning keras lstm,based on this answer for which i performed some tests statefulfalse normally statefulfalse you have one batch with many sequences the shape is this means that you have batch individual sequences this is batch size and it can vary steps per sequence feature per step every time you train either if you repeat this batch or if you pass a new one it will see individual sequences every sequence is a unique entry statefultrue when you go to a stateful layer you are not going to pass individual sequences anymore you are going to pass very long sequences divided in small batches you will need more batches both shapes are and this means that you have batches individual sequences this is batch size and it must be constant steps per sequence steps in each batch feature per step the stateful layers are meant to huge sequences long enough to exceed your memory or your available time for some task then you slice your sequences and process them in parts there is no difference in the results the layer is not smarter or has additional capabilities it just doesnt consider that the sequences have ended after it processes one batch it expects the continuation of those sequences in this case you decide yourself when the sequences have ended and call modelresetstates manually

70434454,how to avoid gensim simple preprocess to remove digits,python gensim,the simplepreprocess function is just one rather simple convenience option for tokenizing text from a string into a listoftokens its not especially welltuned for any particular need and it has no configurable option to retain tokens that dont match its particular hardcoded pattern patalphabetic which rulesout tokens with leading digits many projects will want to apply their own tokenizationpreprocessing instead better suited to their data problem domain if you need ideas for how to start youc can consult the actual source code for simplepreprocess and other functions it relies upon like tokenize simpletokenize that gensim uses
69654710,tokenizing the data properly in gensim,python gensim,that will work but because gensims linesentence class what i assume you mean breaks tokens on whitespace your line will become the list of wordtokens that means tokens like space sentences nuts will be treated as words potentially even receiving trained wordvectors too if they appear at least mincount times thats probably not what you want but also not necessarily a big problem in a sufficientlylarge corpus all the words you care about will appear so many times without this connectedpunctuation issue youll probably still get good vectors for them but more typically youd preprocess your text to either strip that punctuation or split it off from words with extra space delimiter characters when you do that the punctuation marks themselves become words of a sort

66665981,should i split sentences in a document for docvec,gensim wordvec docvec,both approaches are going to be very similar in their effect the slight difference is that in pvdm modes dm or pvdbow with added skipgram training dm dbowwords if you split by sentence words in different sentences will never be within the same contextwindow for example your doc words word and word would never be averagedtogether in the same pvdm contextwindowaverage nor be used to pvdbow skipgram predicteachother if you split by sentences if you just run the whole docs words together into a single taggeddocument example they would interact more via appearing in shared contextwindows whether one or the other is better for your purposes is something youd have to evaluate in your own analysis it could depend a lot on the nature of the data desired similarity results but i can say that your second option all the words in one taggeddocument is the more commontraditional approach that is as long as the document is still no more than tokens long if longer splitting the docs words into multiple taggeddocument instances each with the same tags is a common workaround for an internal token implementation limit
66448514,memory error in python using gensimutilssimplepreprocess,python memory gensim wordvec,it appears that attempting to hold all the documents in a list in memory requires more ram than your system has perhaps also one of the files is gigantic whats the largest single file its not necessary to hold all docs in memory gensims wordvec other algorithms can almost always accept any python iterable object one that can iterate over its contents onebyone repeatedly even if theyre coming from some other backend this typically uses far less ram the leader of the gensim project has a useful post about iterables that could help you adapt your readinput function into a wrapper class that can reiterate over the files repeatedly two other notes simplepreprocess isnt especially sophisticated and you may want to do your own tokenization instead but if you retokenize on every iteration especially if your tokenization does anything sophisticated or uses regularexpressions youre doing a lot of redundant retokenizing of the same texts which is likely to be a bottleneck in your training so in fact you might want to just use your readinput not to stuff all rokenized docs into a list but write them to a new file posttokenization onedocument to a line and all tokens separated by single spaces then a utility class like gensims linesentence can provide the iterablewrapper for feeding that almostfullyready file to wordvec
64151977,extract token frequencies from gensim model,python gensim,those answers are correct for reading the declared tokencounts out of a model which has them but in some cases your model may only have been initialized with a fake descendingby count for each word this is most likely in using gensim if it was loaded from a source where either the counts werent available or werent used in particular if you created the model using loadwordvecformat that simple vectorsonly format whether binary or plaintext inherently contains no word counts but such words are almost always by convention sorted in mostfrequent to leastfrequent order so gensim has chosen when frequencies are not present to synthesize fake counts with linearly descending int values where the first mostfrequent word begins with the count of all unique words and the last leastfrequent word has a count of im not sure this is a good idea but gensims been doing it for a while and it ensures code relying on the pertoken count wont break and will preserve the original order though obviously not the unknowable original trueproportions in some cases the original source of the file may have saved a separate vocab file with the wordfrequencies alongside the wordvecformat vectors in googles original wordvecc code release this is the file generated by the optional savevocab flag in gensims savewordvecformat method the optional fvocab parameter can be used to generate this side file if so that vocab frequencies filename may be supplied when you call loadwordvecformat as the fvocab parameter and then your vectorset will have true counts if you wordvectors were originally created in gensim from a corpus giving actual frequencies and were always savedloaded using the gensim native functions saveload which use an extended form of pythonpickling then the original true count info will never have been lost if youve lost the original frequency data but you know the data was from a real naturallanguage source and you want a more realistic but still faked set of frequencies an option could be to use the zipfian distribution real naturallanguage usage frequencies tend to roughly fit this tall head long tail distribution a formula for creating such morerealistic dummy counts is available in the answer gensim any chance to get word frequency in wordvec format
60638629,gensim corpus from sparse matrix,python pythonx gensim,the input to mydictdocbow doesnt seem to be correct it takes a list of strings not a single string the list of strings being the document scenario if you consider each column name to be a document ie document is word then you could do these are six documents each sublist with only a single word the tuples in the sublist indicate the wordid frequency so the first document contains word once the second document contains word once etc scenario if you consider your column names to be a single document then you could do where your corpus consists of a single document which contains word to word all once little bit of background instead of working with strings tokens directly like word house etc gensim uses integers that represent a string these integers are word ids to see which word corresponds to which id you can use the bag of words is represented as a tuple with wordid frequency because any given word may occur multiple times in a document especially in longer documents a single word may appear times instead of saving a reference to that word a times gensim is clever and saves wordid instead this then represents that some word occurs times in a document
59926638,how to find number of tokens in gensim model,pythonx gensim,since you already passed in your mylist corpus when you instantiated the model it will have automatically done all steps to train the model with that data you dont need to and almost certainly should not be calling train again typically train should only be called if you didnt provide any corpus at instnatiation and in such a case youd then call both buildvocab and train as noted by other answerers the numbers reported by train are two tallies of the total tokens seen by the training process most users wont actually need this info if you want to know the number of unique tokens for which the model learned wordvectors lenmodelwv is one way before gensim lenmodelwvvocab would have worked
55649311,how to only return actual tokens rather than empty variables when tokenizing,python apply tokenize gensim,there are two solutions to your problem solution your removestopwords requires an array of documents to work properly so you modify your input like this solution you change your removestopwords function to work on a single document
46914513,docvec model splits documents tags in symbols,pythonx gensim docvec,docvec expects the text examples objects of the shape taggeddocument to have a tags property thats a listoftags if you instead supply a string like label it is actually a listofcharacters so its essentially saying thattaggeddocument has tags make sure you make tags a listofonetag for example tagslabel and you should see results in terms of trainedtags more like what you expect separately it appears you have about documents of about words each note wordvecdocvec need large varied datasets to get good results in particular with just texts but vectordimensions the training can get quite good at the training task internal word prediction with little more than memorizing the idiosyncracies of the training set which is essentially overfitting and does not result in vectors whose distancesarrangement represent generalizable knowledge that would transfer to other examples
44964380,gensim loss of wordstokens while training,python gensim wordvec,it should never miss words that were included in the tokenized corpus and had at least mincount occurrences so if you get a keyerror you can be confident that the associated wordtoken was never supplied during training in your example code to reproduce take a close look at i in sentence will be each character of the string its unlikely your unshown wordtokenize function does anything useful with the individual characters j a c k probably just leaving them as a list of letters then appending that to your other sentences makes sentences items longer rather than the single extra tokenized example you expect i suspect your real issue is different but related something wrong with tokenization and composition so check every step individually for the expected results and nestedtypes using unique variables per step like sentencestokenized or sentencetokenized instead of clobberreusing variables like sentences and sentence can help debug update as you suggested as edit the issue with your latest code is that the line where you append is still wrong its appending each word in sentence as if it were its own new sentence looking at the results of each step in the variable contents and lengths should help make this clear also i again recommend not reusing variables for multiple steps while debugging the line in sentences proof that the word is present inside sentences is actually proving sentences is wrong that single word should not be an item in sentences but in its single last listoftokens sentences
39275547,tokenizing a corpus composed of articles into sentences python,python deeplearning gensim wordvec,so gensims wordvec requires this format for its training input sentences first sentence second sentence i assume your documents contain more than one sentence you should first split by sentences you can do that with nltk you might need to download the model first then tokenize each sentence and put everything together in a list unfortunately i am not good enough with pandas to perform all the operations in a pandastic way pay a lot of attention to the parameters of wordvec picking them right can make a huge difference

16553252,gensim importerror in pycharm no module named scipysparse,python scipy pycharm lda gensim,id suggest using the pythonorg version of python not the one that came with osx as there are some issues that are most easily overcome by installing the latest version in the case of the x branch dont worry about breaking anything both versions will happily coexist together once you have that you can install the latest numpy and scipy binaries get the dmg files numpy is required for scipy to work make sure you set up pycharm to work with the new version of python and doublecheck that your modules are installed in the right sitepackages directory it should be libraryframeworkspythonframeworkversionslibpythonsitepackages you can always copy all of the files in your librarypythonsitepackages directory to the one i just mentioned as the majorminor version of python is still the same then you should be good to go you will likely want to symlink usrlocalbinpython to libraryframeworkspythonframeworkversionsbinpython it may be already to make an easier shebang line and dont forget to put usrlocalbin in front of usrbin in your path for when you do commandline work and for usrbinenv python shebangs good luck
78841275,what are tokens top k and top p,machinelearning deeplearning artificialintelligence googlegemini,you can find those details at the model parameters documentation but in a short max output tokens limits the response max length you literally limit how short or long you want your answer in tokens roughly speaking just as a reference tokens is around words gemini is a generative model which means that in a high level explanation it composes or generates an answer given its semantic knowledge in a given language being a spoken language a programming language etc so basically you can imagine a bag of possible next tokens when writing a sentence and topk and topp will customize the possible vocabulary to be considered with topk basically you limit the possible tokens universe if the next tokens can be possible different ones you limit in the top first k ones so topk means that the model you consider the first tokens in the possible list but the next tokens is not picked yet at this step with topp you will work on a limit based on the cumulative probability meaning each token will have a probability related to how often the model saw the previous token followed by this token so if you define topp each means that from the token you limited with topk it will generate a new list with the tokens that sum a max probability of ie if the first token has a probability the second has the third has and the fifth has the list after the topp analysis will contain the first the second and the third yet the next token is not picked in the step too finally comes the temperature parameter which defines how deterministic the next token will be picked a temperature equals to drives the more deterministic choice where the token with higher priority will be chosen temperature at maximum will be the more random choice of next token which means that even the less probable token may be chosen too hope that helps
